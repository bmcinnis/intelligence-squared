(lp388
S'We need to abolish the minimum wage.'
p389
aS"And there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument."
p390
aS'Does the minimum wage make the world a better place?'
p391
aS'And does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest American families and the workers who are in those families?'
p392
aS'Now, those Americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades.'
p393
aS'They find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers.'
p394
aS'Their job opportunities have shrunk.'
p395
aS'Their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people.'
p396
aS'It attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes.'
p397
aS"And by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help."
p398
aS"You don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work."
p399
aS"Now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are -- that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up."
p400
aS"But in reality, most of us don't need that extra help."
p401
aS'95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million Americans -- 95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already.'
p402
aS'And that includes my cleaning lady, who I pay over two times the minimum wage.'
p403
aS'Now, why do I do that?'
p404
aS"Because I'm an incredibly nice person."
p405
aS"Well, that's what I like to think."
p406
aS"But I really know better, because I'm an economist."
p407
aS"The reason I play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if I don't, she doesn't show up."
p408
aS"She has other alternatives that she will turn to if I don't meet her market wage."
p409
aS'It is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers.'
p410
aS"And alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force."
p411
aS'But the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million Americans.'
p412
aS'About half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24.'
p413
aS'They get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage.'
p414
aS'But those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience.'
p415
aS'This is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent.'
p416
aS"And for African Americans -- young African Americans, it's over 29 percent."
p417
aS'Almost one in three.'
p418
aS"Now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment."
p419
aS"But who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs?"
p420
aS"That's why employers replace workers with machines."
p421
aS"That's why they send factories overseas."
p422
aS"And that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture."
p423
aS'And by the way, the U.S. manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving.'
p424
aS"But in employment terms, it's struggling."
p425
aS'And those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job.'
p426
aS'Those opportunities are shrinking.'
p427
aS"Why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school -- why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off?"
p428
aS'Why would it have no effect on their employment?'
p429
aS'Consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship.'
p430
aS'The internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage.'
p431
aS'You pay zero.'
p432
aS"You're allowed to pay zero."
p433
aS"You're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero."
p434
aS'How strange is that?'
p435
aS"But we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing."
p436
aS"It's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their -- at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace."
p437
aS'And thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero.'
p438
aS"Does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people?"
p439
aS'Others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small -- the employment effects.'
p440
aS'Small?'
p441
aS"When you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent."
p442
aS"So it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work?"
p443
aS"We're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many."
p444
aS"I don't accept that tradeoff."
p445
aS"That's a tragedy."
p446
aS'I reject it.'
p447
aS"It's a bad bargain."
p448
aS'The irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end.'
p449
aS'It reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them.'
p450
aS'The best argument for the minimum wage is that our school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom.'
p451
aS'But this is the wrong way to fix it.'
p452
aS"It's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of America, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education, the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career."
p453
aS"I beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results."
p454
aS'Abolish the minimum wage.'
p455
aS'Let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper.'

S"Well, I'm glad to see all of you here and that you've chosen this over other D.C. options you had tonight."
p552
aS"You could be looking at the cherry blossoms or seeing the Nationals play, but you've come to talk and debate the minimum wage, so you're my kind of people."
p553
aS"So I'm glad you're here."
p554
aS'Here is my main point.'
p555
aS'Luckily, for our side, strongly against abolishing the minimum wage, almost everything you just heard from Russ is shown to be false by a large body of compelling research.'
p556
aS'So let me start with my main point.'
p557
aS'Abolishing the minimum wage would be a terrible policy mistake that would needlessly hurt millions of low wage workers.'
p558
aS"It's not a policy, this idea of abolishing the minimum wage."
p559
aS'This policy is nowhere near the current agenda.'
p560
aS"In fact, as you've heard, the current debate asks whether the minimum wage should be increased."
p561
aS"Now, it is true that during the Republican primary, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain endorsed the idea in the Republican primary of abolishing the minimum wage, but that idea of abolishing a policy that's been in place since the 1930s, helping low wage workers, is about as far out of the mainstream as you can get, and let me explain why."
p562
aS"Now, this gray hair I have, I got through a lifetime, as was mentioned earlier, of analyzing social and economic policies, beginning as a social worker in New York City with the poor, and I worked my way -- I don't want to say up, sideways, wherever it is I am now -- to whatever it is I'm doing today."
p563
aS"And, you know, over those decades, I focused on two things, what's gone wrong in our economy and which policies could help give less advantaged folks a shot, a fair chance?"
p564
aS"It's through that simple agenda that decades ago I became interested in minimum wage policy."
p565
aS'As globalization, and technological change, and a lot of other stuff that we can talk about throughout the evening have evolved, economic growth no longer reaches working families the way it used to.'
p566
aS"And the further you go down the pay scale, the less growth you're likely to see."
p567
aS'The minimum wage partially helps offset that problem.'
p568
aS'And, in fact, you will be hard pressed to find a policy that does what it sets out to do, raising the pay of low wage workers, more effectively or more efficiently.'
p569
aS"And importantly, and this is why I stressed it when I started, and we'll have lots of time to get into this, I hope, reams of high quality research shows that it does so with the minimum of the type of side effects that you heard Russ emphasize."
p570
aS'Consider this, just start here with a little commonsense thought experiment.'
p571
aS"The American minimum wage, as you've heard, has been in place since 1938, 75 years ago."
p572
aS'It has been raised 22 times.'
p573
aS'Nineteen states now have their own minimum wages above the federal level.'
p574
aS'If this policy was so damaging, as damaging as Russ claims, that it needs to be abolished, how could it be that citizens and legislatures in 19 states decided not to abolish it, but to raise it above the federal level?'
p575
aS'If it was anywhere near as damaging as our opponents claim, how could the minimum wage not only have survived this long, but have flourished and expanded?'
p576
aS"The answer, once again, is because it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers, and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelmingly support the policy -- that's very important, I'll come back to that -- as doing what it's supposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way."
p577
aS'Now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, would figuratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many of whom -- and Karen will emphasize these points -- depend on the minimum wage to support their families.'
p578
aS"It's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers issue."
p579
aS"It's not."
p580
aS"For these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in the federal -- in the federal minimum wage."
p581
aS"Now, that's what we ought to actually be debating."
p582
aS'I firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debates about that kind of a proposal -- should the minimum wage be increased or not?'
p583
aS"But that's not what we're arguing about."
p584
aS"That's not what you're voting on on the resolution."
p585
aS'Our opponents think that America should have no minimum wage at all.'
p586
aS'To me, a better question than that -- than the one on notice tonight, should be -- should the minimum wage be abolished?'
p587
aS'The better question is why anyone would even suggest such a bad idea?'
p588
aS'So, why would you -- why would you even think that?'
p589
aS'And I think the answer comes down to two factors.'
p590
aS'First, common misconceptions, ones that should have been banished by the research.'
p591
aS'And second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense and empirical evidence.'
p592
aS'Now, a word about this evidence.'
p593
aS"There's probably no question that's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers."
p594
aS'And the conclusion is that it raises the pay of low-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects.'
p595
aS"Of literally thousands of estimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, the vast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers -- the benefits to low-wage workers -- exactly the opposite of what's -- of what Russell claims -- the benefits for low- wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss."
p596
aS'Now, recall that I mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levels exist.'
p597
aS"That's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rare in economics -- pseudo-experimentation."
p598
aS'The best way to test the impact of an intervention like this is to compare places that are as like -- as -- in terms of economic variables as you can find.'
p599
aS"Yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't."
p600
aS'These studies, this pseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistently found results, job loss effects, that hover around zero.'
p601
aS'Sometimes a little bit below.'
p602
aS'I will grant the other side that.'
p603
aS'Sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive, but hover around zero.'
p604
aS"So we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed to do with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects."
p605
aS'Abolishing it makes absolutely no sense at all.'

aS"The answer, once again, isbecause it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers,and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelminglysupport the policy -- that's very important, I'll come back to that -- as doing what it'ssupposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way.Now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, wouldfiguratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many ofwhom -- and Karen will emphasize these points -- depend on the minimum wage tosupport their families."
p635
aS"It's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers issue."
p636
aS"It'snot."
p637
aS"For these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in thefederal -- in the federal minimum wage."
p638
aS"Now, that's what we ought to actually bedebating."
p639
aS'I firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debatesabout that kind of a proposal -- should the minimum wage be increased or not?'
p640
aS"Butthat's not what we're arguing about."
p641
aS"That's not what you're voting on on the resolution.Our opponents think that America should have no minimum wage at all."
p642
aS'To me, abetter question than that -- than the one on notice tonight, should be -- should theminimum wage be abolished?'
p643
aS'The better question is why anyone would even suggestsuch a bad idea?'
p644
aS'So, why would you -- why would you even think that?And I think the answer comes down to two factors.'
p645
aS'First, common misconceptions,ones that should have been banished by the research.And second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense andempirical evidence.'
p646
aS'Now, a word about this evidence.'
p647
aS"There's probably no questionthat's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact ofthe minimum wage on low-wage workers."
p648
aS'And the conclusion is that it raises the pay oflow-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects.'
p649
aS"Of literally thousands ofestimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, thevast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers -- the benefits to low-wageworkers -- exactly the opposite of what's -- of what Russell claims -- the benefits for low-wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss.Now, recall that I mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levelsexist."
p650
aS"That's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rarein economics -- pseudo-experimentation."
p651
aS"The best way to test the impact of anintervention like this is to compare places that are as like -- as -- in terms of economicvariables as you can find.Yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't."
p652
aS'These studies, thispseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistentlyfound results, job loss effects, that hover around zero.'
p653
aS'Sometimes a little bit below.'
p654
aS'Iwill grant the other side that.'
p655
aS"Sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive,but hover around zero.So we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed todo with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects."
p656
aS'Abolishing it makesabsolutely no sense at all.'

p697
aS'Actually, the preponderance ofevidence is in favor of the fact that the minimum wage does destroy jobs.'
p698

p699
aS"And nobody's ever disproven the law of demand, not evenJared.Nobody in Congress has disproven the law of demand."

p711
aS"Andthat's what's wrong with the minimum wage to a large extent."
p712
aS"It reduces -- it reduces --it doesn't increase workers' bargaining power because it makes it illegal for the workerto offer her labor services for less than the minimum even though she's willing to do sobecause that's a better opportunity for her."
p713
aS'And it makes it illegal for the employer tohire that worker.'
p714
aS"Also, it should be obvious that if you increase the wage rate above thegoing market wage rate, if it's only a little bit above, it's not going to have much of aneffect."
p715
aS"But if it's quite a bit above, as happened in New York State in the early 2000s,then it led to a about 20 percent decrease in the unemployment rate in New York Statefor teenage workers aged about 16 to 24 without a high school diploma."
p716
aS'They kind ofcut off the bottom rung for the ladder.'
p717
aS"They couldn't get in the market.There was a surplus."
p718
aS"There's lots of jobs when the wage rate is lower; when if goeshigher, there's fewer jobs."
p719

p720
aS"The government promises people a minimum wage, but the politicians can't keepthat promise because there's two sides to the market."
p721
aS'The employers will not hire asmany workers when the wage rate goes up.'
p722
aS'And in the short run, there may not bemuch unemployment.'
p723
aS'But in the longer run, as Russ pointed out, the employers willsubstitute skilled workers for unskilled workers.'
p724
aS'They might use a computer and haveone worker rather than ten, or they may substitute labor-saving devices.'
p725
aS"And there'slots of evidence to show this."
p726
aS'Just an article in the Wall Street Journal over theweekend, woman was running -- she runs bakeries, cupcake bakeries.'
p727
aS'She hires -- shehas about ten young workers working for her.'

p732
aS'We can play games with statistics.'
p733
aS"And there's apreponderance of evidence, as I said, that the minimum wage has these detrimentaleffects."

aS'It also destroysjobs, jobs that used to be done in the United States.'

p747
aS'How do you explain these huge unemployment rates among blackmale teenagers that are, you know, over 30 percent?'
p748
aS'In Spain, they have a very rigidminimum wage.'
p749
aS'And the unemployment rate there is 26 percent, the national rate.'
p750
aS'Theunemployment rate among younger workers -- unskilled workers who are typicallyyounger workers, is double that.'
p751
aS'How do you explain that?The minimum wage, also, by the way, does not reduce the poverty rate.'
p752
aS'Poverty ratehas actually increased a little bit because of the minimum wage.'
p753
aS'Doug Adie and otherpeople have looked at that; Neumark as well.'
p754
aS"And if you can't get a job -- because,remember, the law -- what does it do?"
p755
aS"It increases the wage rate, but if you don't get ajob, your income is zero."

p899
aS"Our opponents have been talking about teens and letting them work for less money, but we're talking about a knowledge economy where we want to compete for high-wage jobs, and the people who are going to take those -- the children growing up in those families are the ones who are going to be the human capital of our society going forward."

p963
aS"Let's talk about what would happen to real peoplein real families if the U.S. were to go down this untested and quite radical path ofeliminating the minimum wage as our opponents urge."
p964
aS'What I want you to understandis that roughly one quarter of all children in the United States, more than 17 millionchildren, have a parent earning the minimum wage or just above.'
p965
aS"Another way to thinkabout this, only -- almost one of three of those who benefit from the minimum wage, sothey're just at the minimum wage or they're just above it, and so they're what we thinkthat their wages are bumped up because of the minimum wage, are parents."
p966
aS"One inthree.That means that today, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage because ofthe low level of our minimum wage is still living below the poverty line at today's levelof the minimum wage."
p967
aS'These families, as Jared and I have actually studied, work moreand more hours and yet still have to make terrible choices every day.'
p968
aS'They have tochoose, "Do I pay for childcare or leave my little child alone?'

aS'Can I afford healthcare?'

p972
aS'Howcan they even consider that?'
p973
aS'I want to think beyond that family and what theimplications of pulling out the rug under them would mean for the rest of us.'
p974
aS"First of all,let's think about the knowledge economy."
p975
aS"Our opponents have been talking aboutteens and letting them work for less money, but we're talking about a knowledgeeconomy where we want to compete for high-wage jobs, and the people who are goingto take those -- the children growing up in those families are the ones who are going tobe the human capital of our society going forward.They're going to pay your and my Social Security."
p976
aS"They're growing up in those families,earning those very low wages."
p977

aS'Social mobility in the U.S. -- the U.S. used to be the home where, if youwere brought -- born into a poor family, you could make good.'

aS"We're behind France in social mobility."

aS'So do we really want to go backwards,get further away from the American dream?'

aS"No, I don't think so."
p987
aS'I think we want torestore the American dream, not turn this country into a Dickensian nightmare.'
p988
aS'Inequality, closely related to social mobility -- inequality is approaching record levels.And we think that half of the increase in inequality is a result of the falling minimumwage, half of the increase in inequality for those at the lower end.'
p989
aS"Then there's theissue of our economic recovery -- our fragile economic recovery."
p990
aS'If the minimum wage -- if abolishing the minimum wage had any effect at all, it would surely take money out ofthe economy.'

aS'In fact, it would act as a reverse stimulus.'

aS"So let's think very carefullybefore we go down this road as a society."
p993
aS"I'd like to bring up women, as the onlywoman on this panel."
p994
aS'Over half of those who earn the minimum wage are women, andthese women obviously already face disadvantages.'
