p393
aS"To understand why FDA's caution is hazardous to our health, you have to appreciate FDA's growing focus on statistical outcomes over results for patients."
p394
aS'Fading at FDA is a mindset of clinical medicine and patient care.'
p395
aS'And in it is a growing fixation on the statistical results, clinical trials, and a growing rule by math over medicine.'
p396
aS'This mindset can be seen in the triage that now hamper clinical trials and drug development.'
p397
aS'FDA imposes increasingly onerous experiments to try to ferret out benefits from new drugs.'
p398
aS"And FDA reviewers want the results of clinical trials to insulate them from critics; critics who say they're not doing enough about drug safety."
p399
aS'But the laborious trials that result come at a very big, human cost.'
p400
aS"Higher degrees of statistical certainty under FDA's outdated way of designing drug trials require longer, larger, and increasingly impractical studies, especially when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs."
p401
aS"Some promising therapies simply aren't being developed."
p402
aS'Let me tell you one story of how this mindset impacts patients.'
p403
aS"Hunter's Syndrome is part of a family of related and extremely rare disorders."
p404
aS'All are inherited.'
p405
aS"Each robs children of the ability to produce a crucial enzyme that's used by the body to break down certain sugar molecules found in the blood."
p406
aS'Missing these enzymes, these molecules end up accumulating in places like the liver, and the spleen, and the joints, with often painful and debilitating consequences.'
p407
aS'Before treatment came along, parents had to literally sit idly by and watch as these diseases destroyed their children.'
p408
aS'But by the 1990s, drugs were developed that could function as replacements for the enzymes that were missing in these related disorders.'
p409
aS'These disorders were so bad and the drugs were so promising that the first of these medicines, a drug for Gauchers Disease called Ceredase, was approved on the basis of a very simple clinical trial that involved only a dozen patients.'
p410
aS"By 2004, FDA had approved enzyme replacements for four other conditions that were each very similar to Hunter's Syndrome."
p411
aS'All were lysosomal storage diseases, where kids were born missing one of these crucial and related enzymes.'
p412
aS'It was understood that if you could replace the enzyme, these children were likely to derive a therapeutic benefit.'
p413
aS"But when an experimental enzyme for Hunter's Syndrome finally came along, a decade after that original drug was approved for Gauchers Disease, FDA's regulatory norms and FDA's regulatory culture had changed dramatically."
p414
aS'In an effort to satisfy an increasingly demanding desire for statistical certainty, the FDA trial imposed extraordinary hardships on the children and their families.'
p415
aS"In order to approve the Hunter's drug, called Elaprase, FDA required that the trial enroll 96 patients."
p416
aS'This was fully 20 percent of all the Americans afflicted with the disorder.'
p417
aS'And instead of testing the drug for six months, as had been done for every other drug, all of these enzyme replacements, FDA wanted a full year of clinical data, 52 weekly infusions in these kids.'
p418
aS'FDA also insisted that the kids be randomly assigned to receive either a drug or a placebo.'
p419
aS'There was no need to have a placebo in this clinical trial.'
p420
aS'The disease follows a very predictable pattern.'
p421
aS'And doctors already knew the normal decline these kids would have if they were left untreated.'
p422
aS'But leaving some kids untreated was basically leaving them to become disabled.'
p423
aS'Yet, including the placebo helped give the trial itself more statistical rigor for FDA.'
p424
aS'Finally, in past trials, with all these lysosomal storage drugs, these enzyme replacements, drugs targeted to similar diseases, FDA asked companies to measure surrogate markers that the -- the drug was having an impact on disease.'
p425
aS'Like the ability to shrink organs, like the liver and the spleen.'
p426
aS"That was interpreted as proof that the drug was breaking down the sugar molecules and they weren't becoming deposited there."
p427
aS'And this would mean that the enzyme replacement was working.'
p428
aS'By looking at these surrogate measures, which you could measure over a shorter period of time, it was a way to accelerate the development of the drug.'
p429
aS"But in the case of the Hunter's drug, Elaprase, FDA decided to test the ability of the children to walk and to breathe as the clinical outcome it wanted."
p430
aS'FDA saw this as a more rigorous way to see if the drug was working, but it came with hard trade-offs.'
p431
aS'It made the trial much longer than it needed to be.'
p432
aS'You had to wait years for the kids to become disabled to see if the drug was having its impact and to measure the result.'
p433
aS'And it tested the boundaries of what was ethical.'
p434
aS"Yet, this story is increasingly the norm when it comes to FDA review culture and it's played out multiple times in recent years, so much so that observers who follow the FDA now believe that the Europeans have become more flexible when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs than the Americans."
p435
aS"The drug for bone cancer, the drug Pirfenidone for ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the drug Tafamidis for familial amyloidosis, all rejected by FDA in recent years because the statistical results didn't meet the agency's requirements, all approved in Europe, all embraced by European regulators."
p436
aS"To understand why FDA's caution is, at times, hazardous, you have to recognize FDA's growing resolve to make sure the trials supporting drug approval meet an arduous but increasingly outdated standard for proving efficacy."
p437
aS'As my debate partner, Peter Huber will show, this outdated model that FDA uses exacerbates these problems by making trials much more inefficient than they should be and allowing us to learn far less from the results than we otherwise can.'
p438
aS'Yet surveys of people with life-threatening disorders continue to show that patients want access to promising drugs sooner.'
p439
aS"They're willing to tolerate some risk."
p440
aS"They're willing to tolerate the uncertainty."
p441
aS'For patients with unmet medical needs, what kind of FDA do we want; an FDA that advances care, an FDA that gets new science to the patient more quickly?'
p442
aS"What we can't have is an FDA that's ruled by statistics over medicine."
p443
aS"We can't have an FDA that focuses on its process rather than advancing patient care."
p444

p523
aS'it is not an easycall.But I think the most important aspect of the question before us is, in general, do wewant to have an FDA that is thinking very hard about risks and benefits and is requiringthat the manufacturers who bring drugs to the FDA demonstrate that, in sum, the drugis going to be better for patients and not run the risk that we have all seen in recentyears of a Vioxx or an Avandia that actually caused heart attacks and strokes becausethose problems were not detected.'
p524
aS"Now, there are a number of myths that underlie theproposition that I think it's important to just dismiss early on."
p525

p526
aS'And in fact, these are questions that one can look at with real data.'
p527
aS'And the real data do not bear out the assertion that Dr. Gottlieb is defending.'
p528
aS'There isa very high acceptance rate by FDA of new drugs.In an article in Forbes from last December, it documented that 77 percent of drugs areapproved the first time around, and a very high proportion of the ones where FDA says,Please go back and find some more information out for us, are then approved thesecond time around.'
p529
aS'In 2012, the FDA approved 39 new drugs, which was way higherthan it has approved in any number of years for the last 16.'
p530
aS'It was a 16-year high.'
p531
aS'SoFDA is indeed saying yes to drugs, and it is doing so at a rapid clip.'
p532
aS"That's the other myththat we need to disabuse ourselves of."
p533
aS'In fact, the salaries of the FDA staff that reviewdrugs are, for better or worse, half paid by the drug industry, which creates with it somedeadlines that, as a result of the so-called user fees, the FDA must have its deadlinesmet.'
p534
aS"And for a priority drug, which is an important new drug that brings something tothe table that we don't already have, that is needed by patients, that deadline is sixmonths."
p535
aS'And in the last year, 33 out of the 35 drugs that were brought to FDA met theirstandard, whether it was six months for a priority review or ten months for a standardreview.You need a lot of time to be able to look at all of the adverse effects that happen, whatis the degree of benefit.'
p536
aS"And again, I'm sure that there are instances where it couldhave been done better."
p537
aS'And there certainly are ways that, as was mentioned in theearly presentation by Mr. Rosenkranz, where we would like to be bring in genetics andbring in new molecular theories to approve drugs.'
p538
aS"And that's great, and FDA is tryingvery hard to move in that direction."
p539
aS'But in fact, FDA is saying yes most of the time.'
p540
aS'It isapproving drugs quickly, as per its requirements.'
p541
aS'And in a paper last year in the "NewEngland Journal of Medicine" by Dr. Ross and colleagues from Yale, reasonableuniversity, reasonable journal, they look at whether or not the FDA was in fact slowerthan other regulatory agencies.'
p542
aS'And so they looked at the European medicines agency,which is the pan-European FDA equivalent, and Health Canada which is the Canadianversion of FDA.And it found that, in fact, review times in the U.S. were shorter for FDA than they werefor the Europeans and for the Canadians.'
p543
aS'And in fact for drugs that were approved inboth places, 64 percent of the time they were approved first in the U.S. before inEurope, and 86 percent of the time, they were approved in the U.S. before Canada.'
p544
aS'Sothe myth that somehow FDA is slowing things down is not borne out by the facts.'
p545
aS"Thereason we don't have as many new drugs as all of us on this stage and the audiencewould like to have is because the pharmaceutical industry is not bringing a lot of newdrugs to FDA to approve."
p546
aS"And they can't approve a drug that is not submitted to them."
p547
aS"And yet they have this tension because they need to be able to have a drug brought tothem, and yet they know, and we know, that manufacturers' enthusiasm, to put it askindly as we can, about a product that they're trying to market, is perhaps not alwaysgoing to catch all the down sides."
p548
aS"And we've all seen examples of that.So there needs to be an agency that represents the best interests of the American publicand can say to the manufacturer, That does sound promising, but there are somethings that you really need to look at, and if it's an important new drug, we'll get you ananswer in six months."
p549
aS"I don't think that's too much to expect of a company to do,especially since we know that any drug that is powerful enough to make a difference inpatients' lives is also powerful enough to do something that we don't want it to do anddidn't expect it to do."
p550

p551
aS'There does need to be a cautious agency out there looking at drugs.'

aS'AndDr.'
p553
aS"Challoner later will talk about devices, which is the other piece of FDA'sresponsibility besides food, which we're not going to get into."
p554
aS'And we need to havesomething interposed between an enthusiastic company, which has billions of dollarsriding on the success of its product, and the public health of the American people.And there needs to be a rigorous review.'
p555
aS'That rigorous review can be done quickly, itcan -- and it is being done quickly.'
p556
aS'It is generally favorable.'

S"Well, in case you didn't know, our side actually won the first round of this debate in 19 --no, in 1992, when we persuaded the FDA to adopt what is called the acceleratedapproval rule."
p652
aS'Now, I must confess that the rule has been applied not very widely, butin two particular areas and not with whole-hearted enthusiasm, especially of late.'
p653
aS'But Iintend to persuade you that this rule is, in fact, the only place that FDA today for we areactually making use of the very best, modern pharmacological science that we have.'
p654
aS'It is in fact the protocols that the FDA uses much more often, the un-acceleratedapproval, if you will, where we are actively obstructing the use of those technologiesand is, therefore, in the standard protocols that the FDA has been using for a very longtime that the FDA is actually hazardous to your health.Let me begin by giving you some brief context and a description of where this rule hasbeen applied.'
p655
aS"Go back to 1988, a couple of biochemists from the United States and oneBritish win a Nobel prize for their mastering of what is called a structure-based design.And this is one of the two processes that they've been using ever since to design,precisely, targeted drugs that can hone in on a molecule that is associated with somedisease."
p656
aS'This is some years after HIV arrived in town.'
p657
aS"And they quickly developedseveral drugs that can target different parts of HIV's chemistry, which, until very close tothat time, had been completely incurable.The FDA licenses these drugs at absolutely record speed, applying its acceleratedapproval rule."
p658
aS'And it soon becomes apparent that not one of them is going to be anygood; not for long, not on its own.'
p659
aS'Because the virus mutates so fast that you throw anysingle drug at it and it very quickly develops a resistance to it.'
p660
aS"You just can't beat it withone drug."
p661
aS"But doctors at this point, because the drug's been licensed, are now free towork things out on their own."
p662
aS'And they very quickly began assembling these drugs incocktails and that does the trick.The other -- the second area where the rule has actually been applied quite aggressivelyfor the last 20 years, is oncology.'
p663
aS"And it's -- here's a brief picture of the kind of medicinethat has emerged in that area."
p664
aS'There are at least 10 biochemically distinct breastcancers out there.'
p665
aS"It's not one disease."
p666
aS'We treat some of them with estrogen blockers.We treat others with estrogen itself.'
p667
aS'Okay.'
p668
aS'One of the estrogen blockers performs wellonly if you have the right liver.'
p669
aS"It depends -- it has to be metabolized by your liver.You know, some patients have the right liver, others don't."
p670
aS'There are at least two othermajor receptors and two classes of drugs in breast cancers.'
p671
aS'And you mix them all up invarious ways to try and beat the disease in the individual patient.'
p672
aS"We're finding similarlevels of complexity and diversity in almost all of the major intractable diseases we'refacing now: the neurological, the autoimmune diseases, and indeed, in many verycommon diseases like diabetes; they just aren't going to be beaten with one size fits alldrugs."
p673
aS"The underlying chemistry isn't going to allow it, which is bad news for the FDA,because the FDA's standard protocols are actually pretty good at getting licensing onesize fits all drugs."
p674
aS'But they are worse than useless, it turns out, when they encountercomplexity.'
p675
aS'Using accelerated approval, the FDA can, in fact, handle complexityreasonably well.'
p676
aS"And it's going to do it even better.In your book, Dr. -- I'd surmise you'd not like this rule at all."
p677
aS"You attribute its origins toAIDS activists who terrified the agency with a massive sit-in.Here's another view."
p678
aS'The rule has allowed for the development of pioneering andlifesaving HIV and cancer drugs over the past two decades.'
p679
aS"That quotes from PresidentObama's Council of Scientific Advisers in a report issued last September; and the reportrecommends that the FDA use accelerated approval much more systematically andbroadly for all drugs that address an unmet need in treating a serious illness.Notice -- this is why we have one lawyer for three doctors."
p680
aS'Notice that the report didnot endorse accelerated approval because it got drugs to patients sooner.'
p681
aS'It said thatthe rule allowed for the development of those pioneering drugs.'
p682
aS"But for the rule, weprobably wouldn't have many of those drugs at all, which means that the benefits ofthat rule have absolutely dwarfed anything that our opponents here can possibly tellyou about the rare side effects that might have been missed when that rule was applied.HIV has killed an average of about 20,000 Americans a year in the 30 years since it'ssurfaced in the United States.The numbers would have been horrendously worse if for the last 20 years we didn'thave some good treatments for the disease in the place."
p683
aS'We owe 40 cancer drugs and15 new treatments to accelerated approval.'
p684
aS'They have given years of additional life tomany patients.'
p685
aS"There is no story about safety and side effects that can possiblyapproach those numbers.So this magic rule doesn't just get us the drugs we need licensed faster."
p686
aS"It gets themlicensed when the other -- the FDA's other rules, the slow rules, just won't license themat all."
p687
aS'How?'
p688
aS"In brief, it -- what it does is it loosens the FDA's grip on -- throttling grip onthe process just enough to let doctors get involved and work out the really good drugscience using the very best tools available."
p689
aS"I want to briefly take the time to tell youhow this is working, because, you know, it's not really that complicated and you canmake your own judgments about how whether it makes sense.First of all, ordinarily, the FDA won't license a drug until it sees clinical symptoms.Accelerated approval will let you license a drug based on, say, its ability to lower HIVloads in the patients' blood.And by the way, it works in only one in 10 patients."
p690
aS'The FDA can still license it.'
p691
aS"It'llmake an ad hoc: Oh, gee, that looks promising."
p692
aS'We want it.'
p693
aS'Okay?'
p694
aS'Under acceleratedapproval, therefore, the drug gets licensed much sooner.'
p695
aS'But it also gets licensed on avery different kind of evidence.'
p696
aS'The White House report makes clear that this is exactlywhat we should do.'
p697
aS"We should start with the premise that when we have a new drug, itmay well be only one piece of a solution that's giving only partial benefits to a minorityof patients involved in the -- you're sort of enlisted in the drug trial.The FDA standard protocols allow nothing of the sort."
p698
aS'Under the current application ofthe rule, the FDA, again, in a very ad hoc way, says the drug company -- says to the drugcompany implicitly and doctors explicitly, Look, work out the stuff -- the rest, youknow, once you got the drug out there, as they did with HIV.'
p699
aS'The White House reportwould systematize it.'

aS'You know, you would gather torrents of information during thetrials.'

aS"And you would -- and you would use those to work out a drug -- molecularinformation.You'd use those to work out how the patients are doing and why some are faring wellon the drug and others aren't."

aS'That kind of screening of patients and active rearrangingthe trial as it progresses is anathema under the standard FDA protocols.'
p703

p845
aS"But I think the audience needs to understand exactly how we got to the pointwe're in."
p846
aS'What is the process that has produced these problematic results?'
p847
aS'Well, thevast majority of medical devices used in healthcare in the United States are reviewed bythe FDA before entering the marketplace, and are cleared.'
p848
aS"That's a very importantword."
p849
aS'They are not approved for human use in a process called premarket notification,or the 510 clearance process, which is named after the section of the authorizinglegislation in 1976.'
p850
aS"And the FDA has to comply with this because it's legislated that theydo so."
p851
aS"And this was done 35 years ago in the face of rapidly evolving technologies.Then, stimulated by reports of problems, the public, legislators, the general accountingoffice, the DHHS inspector general and the courts, including the Supreme Court of theUnited States, have all questioned the value and logic of this clearance process which isbeing used by a federal agency charged with protecting and promoting the public'shealth.What are the major elements of this process?"
p852
aS'Well, premarket, before a device goesout and is sold to you or your doctor or your hospital, for no-risk devices such as tonguedepressors or manual wheelchairs, for instance, there are about two-thirds of those thatare considered by the FDA and go to market directly and are considered basically of no-or low-risk.The high-risk devices comprise about 1 percent of what the FDA device regulatory folksmust deal with.'
p853
aS'And they do have to have costly and time-consuming premarket trialsbefore approval.'
p854
aS"There's some question whether, in the device case, they are aspowerful as those which already exist for drugs.The moderate risk 510(k) is the large middle ground."
p855
aS"That's about 4,000 applications ayear, and it's about a $3 billion a year industry, a very significant business."
p856
aS'The 510(k)process was put in place by Congress and is not intended to evaluate the safety andeffectiveness of devices.'
p857
aS'It cannot be transformed into a premarket evaluation of safetyand effectiveness as long as the standard for clearance is substantial equivalence to apreviously cleared device perhaps as early as 1976 or prior.So these are called predicates.'
p858
aS"And there's no assurance that a predicate is safe andeffective."

aS"I will be speaking, as was said, against the motion that the FDA's caution is hazardous to your health, in particular, as it relates to the device side of the equation."
p866
aS'The FDA is a public health agency.'
p867
aS'It is responsible for the safety and efficacy of the devices that are used by you, on you, and put in you.'
p868
aS'If anything, the anecdotes of the last decade would indicate that we need more caution in our systems.'
p869
aS'The evidence -- I think this will reverberate with most of you.'
p870
aS'The Shiley heart valve, implanted in patients, many patients, begins after several years shattering and embolizing to your brain and to your peripheral body and killing some patients before they could be replaced.'
p871
aS'The Dalkon Shield IUD: put in women, causing perforation of the uterus, pelvic infections, some deaths, much trauma.'
p872
aS'Chemotherapy infusion pumps, which were poorly calibrated so that the operators could make mistakes and would infuse drugs, toxic drugs, at ten times the rate that they should have because the wrong button was pushed, killing patients.'
p873
aS'Surgical mesh, vaginal mess.'
p874
aS"You've all seen these ads from the legal firms, I'm sure, soliciting your business."
p875
aS'This was a surgical mesh that was used for hernia surgery and then was transformed to be used and promoted to be used in pelvic surgery for women with disastrous infection, and prolapse, and a variety of other results.'
p876
aS'Radiotherapy machines -- a liner accelerator.'
p877
aS'Again, without maximum controls, 10 to 20 times the dose is given to a patient for a pulmonary tumor and drills a hole through them.'
p878
aS'Pacemaker leads: put into you to manage your cardiac rhythm.'
p879
aS'And then after two or three years, widely distributed, many people not knowing they have them, breaking, and arrhythmias and other cardiac rhythm disasters were occurring.'
p880
aS'Metal on metal artificial hips.'
p881
aS'None of you could have missed that.'
p882
aS'Removed poorly, monitored in this country, used widely.'
p883
aS'Now, giving medical -- a metal embolism into patients and causing resurgeries and removals.'
p884
aS'Biliary stents that were approved for use in a very low pressure environment began to be used widely, and promoted widely by industry, for use in veins and arteries elsewhere in the body, in which they collapsed or did not work.'
p885
aS"So I'd say, with this kind of evidence, that the case is almost closed, and we could vote now."
p886
aS"But I think the audience needs to understand exactly how we got to the point we're in."
p887
aS'What is the process that has produced these problematic results?'
p888
aS'Well, the vast majority of medical devices used in healthcare in the United States are reviewed by the FDA before entering the marketplace, and are cleared.'
p889
aS"That's a very important word."
p890
aS'They are not approved for human use in a process called premarket notification, or the 510 clearance process, which is named after the section of the authorizing legislation in 1976.'
p891
aS"And the FDA has to comply with this because it's legislated that they do so."
p892
aS'And this was done 35 years ago in the face of rapidly evolving technologies.'
p893
aS"Then, stimulated by reports of problems, the public, legislators, the general accounting office, the DHHS inspector general and the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States, have all questioned the value and logic of this clearance process which is being used by a federal agency charged with protecting and promoting the public's health."
p894
aS'What are the major elements of this process?'
p895
aS'Well, premarket, before a device goes out and is sold to you or your doctor or your hospital, for no-risk devices such as tongue depressors or manual wheelchairs, for instance, there are about two-thirds of those that are considered by the FDA and go to market directly and are considered basically of no- or low-risk.'
p896
aS'The high-risk devices comprise about 1 percent of what the FDA device regulatory folks must deal with.'
p897
aS'And they do have to have costly and time-consuming premarket trials before approval.'
p898
aS"There's some question whether, in the device case, they are as powerful as those which already exist for drugs."
p899
aS'The moderate risk 510(k) is the large middle ground.'
p900
aS"That's about 4,000 applications a year, and it's about a $3 billion a year industry, a very significant business."
p901
aS'The 510(k) process was put in place by Congress and is not intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of devices.'
p902
aS'It cannot be transformed into a premarket evaluation of safety and effectiveness as long as the standard for clearance is substantial equivalence to a previously cleared device perhaps as early as 1976 or prior.'
p903
aS'So these are called predicates.'
p904
aS"And there's no assurance that a predicate is safe and effective."
p905
aS"There's no practical way to remove these undesirable predicates, and you therefore have a daisy chain of approval requirements in the process."
