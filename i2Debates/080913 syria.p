(lp471
S'So thank you very much, John.'
p472
aS"And it's an honor for Rich and I to appear even in a debate with two such distinguished colleagues."
p473
aS'But I want to warn you at the outset that this is a bit of a mismatch.'
p474
aS'Rich and I are academics and think tank types.'
p475
aS"Nick and Nigel are two of the most effective public advocates we've seen in recent times."
p476
aS'Nick is one of my colleagues and friends at Harvard, our offices are about 20 feet apart.'
p477
aS'I introduce him as often as I can to Harvard audiences because I would prefer him to speak than me.'
p478
aS'And always I say, which is what I truly believe, that the U.S. has had no more effective public spokesman in modern times than Nick Burns when he was assistant secretary for public affairs.'
p479
aS'Nigel is a legend -- Nigel is a legend in Washington as the British ambassador to the U.S., who is an extremely, again, effective public spokesman.'
p480
aS"So as you listen to the discussion tonight, I hope you'll think about the evidence and the analysis presented and not the eloquence because if -- -- if that was the case, you can vote now and be done."
p481
aS'So the motion is about a dog in the fight.'
p482
aS'Let me just ask, how many people here have a dog?'
p483
aS'Okay.'
p484
aS"So I just want to see if it's a dog friendly audience."
p485
aS'I think Aspen is usually fairly dog friendly.'
p486
aS'So as you think about the argument tonight, consider this, you go around a corner, you confront dogs in a fight, and you think what to do.'
p487
aS"And compare that with a second case in which you're confronting a dog fight in which one dog has its mouth around the other's throat and you discover that it's your dog."
p488
aS'Now, the question is, "Is this America\'s dog in this fight?'
p489
aS'" So as the moderator reminded us, this assignment tonight is not whether the U.S. should care about the dogs that are tearing each other apart in Syria tonight.'
p490
aS"It's tragic and anybody who looks at it without having their heart torn ought to have a -- you know, an MRI to see if their heart's turned to stone."
p491
aS'The question is, "How much should we care and what should we do about it?'
p492
aS'" So in the language of national security, the question is, "Does what\'s happening in Syria so impact American vital national interests that we\'re compelled to do everything we can including military actions to secure our interests?'
p493
aS'" That\'s what it is to have a vital national interest.'
p494
aS'And, secondly, if the answer to that is, "Yes," or even if you\'re a little shaky on that one, "Has anybody been able to identify a feasible American military intervention that would likely make the situation better over the long run than -- after we had acted than in the case we did not act?'
p495
aS'" So if you think about this be clear and let me be as unambiguous as we can.'
p496
aS'Our answer to these questions -- these two questions are no and no.'
p497
aS"No, the U.S. does not have a vital national interest in what's happening in Syria, and two, no."
p498
aS"No one, is at least to my satisfaction, or Rich's or indeed to Chairman Dempsey, chairman of the JCS, identified a feasible American military intervention, which after the fact would likely make the situation over time better than the alternative."
p499
aS"So, it's to our opponents, I think, to explain how and why they disagree with these judgments, and suggest to us what evidence leads them to that conclusion."
p500
aS"In these opening comments, I'm going to just make some general comments -- general big points, big picture, that bear on the question you have in front of you, and then my colleague, Rich, is going to drill down in more detail."
p501
aS'Four quick points.'
p502
aS"First, Sam Nunn who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, which we're all here as part of, insists that we draw the distinction between vivid and vital."
p503
aS"Because he says whenever something is vivid, especially if it appears on TV over and over and people are being killed, Americans, or many Americans, imagine well, we must have a vital interest there because it's impacting our interests and since we're the world's greatest military super power, maybe there's a military intervention we could undertake to make things better."
p504
aS"In our view, that's not the case here."
p505
aS'This is a vivid, painful, but not vital.'
p506
aS'Vital in the dictionary, read it, says essential for survival and well-being.'
p507
aS'In the mantra of national security it says essential for the preservation of the U.S. as a free society with our fundamental institutions and values intact.'
p508
aS'Syria does not meet that test.'
p509
aS"Now some of you are saying well, maybe that's too high a test."
p510
aS'I mean, could anything threaten our vital interest?'
p511
aS'And I would say in 1990, when Saddam tried to annex Kuwait and threatened the whole possibility of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, President Bush, the father, chose military action and that was the right choice.'
p512
aS"John Donvan Graham Allison, I'm sorry, your introductory remark time is up and concluded."
p513
aS'Thank you very much, Graham Allison.'
p514
aS'John Donvan I want to point out our introductory remarks last six minutes each.'
p515
aS'I gave Graham seven because he spent the first time saying such nice things about the other side, and -- although it might have been a sneak attack.'
p516
aS"I'm not sure."
p517
aS'Also, your timers will say six minutes from this point forward.'
p518
aS'Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria, and here to speak against the motion is our next debater, Nick Burns.'
p519
aS"He's professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Aspen Strategy Group, and former undersecretary of state for political affairs."
p520
aS'Ladies and gentleman, Nicholas Burns.'
p521
aS'Nicholas Burns John, thank you very much.'
p522
aS'Good afternoon everyone.'
p523
aS"It's a pleasure to be here."
p524
aS'Pleasure for Nigel and I to be with Richard and Graham.'
p525
aS"They're both good friends."
p526
aS"I won't try to butter them up anymore."
p527
aS'I need my time, but I will say this.'
p528
aS"We've been asked to address one question."
p529
aS'Does the United States of America have a dog in the fight in Syria?'
p530
aS"The question wasn't whether it's vital."
p531
aS"The question wasn't whether it's feasible."
p532
aS'Do we have an interest in who wins in this fight in Syria?'
p533
aS'And the answer is unequivocally of course, yes, without any question.'
p534
aS'Because Americans should be supporting the Syrian people who have been brutalized by the Syrian dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.'
p535
aS"And we should oppose the Assad regime because it's being supported by Iran and Hezbollah and Russia."
p536
aS"So that's the dog in the fight for the United States."
p537
aS'And what happens in Syria really matters to our country for our national security.'
p538
aS'I would say it matters to every American.'
p539
aS'Let me give you three reasons why.'
p540
aS"First, there's a humanitarian imperative."
p541
aS"I think everybody knows what's been happening."
p542
aS"There's a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria."
p543
aS'More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the last two and a half years, all civilians, 1.8 million Syrian refugees outside the country in Iraq and Turkey and in Jordan in refugee camps, 6.8 million people in need of humanitarian support and of those people, 4.5 million have lost their home in Syria.'
p544
aS"They're on the roads."
p545
aS"They're trying to find a place to live."
p546
aS"They've lost their jobs."
p547
aS'Secretary of State -- former Secretary of State Madeline Albright is here.'
p548
aS'And she and I were in Morocco a couple of months ago.'
p549
aS'We met with the U.N.'
p550
aS'Envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi.'
p551
aS"He told us something I don't think -- I won't forget."
p552
aS'It was very arresting.'
p553
aS'He said, Syria is melting away because of this humanitarian crisis.'
p554
aS'So, do we have a dog in the fight?'
p555
aS'We want to help the Syrian people who have been brutalized by their own regime.'
p556
aS"That's the first reason."
p557
aS'The second reason is geography.'
p558
aS'Look at the map.'
p559
aS'Syria is a neighbor to very important friends and allies of the United States.'
p560
aS"It's a neighbor to Israel."
p561
aS"It's a neighbor to Turkey, to Iraq, to Jordan, and to Lebanon."
p562
aS'So, its central strategic position in the Levant, in the heart of the Middle East, in the heart of the Arab world -- it means that what happens there really matters to the United States and especially to our ally, Israel.'
p563
aS'And third, Syria matters to the United States because who is arming and aiding and financing this regime?'
p564
aS"It's our enemy, Iran."
p565
aS'And its partner Hezbollah.'
p566
aS"And it's our adversary, Russia."
p567
aS'So, if Assad wins, Iran and Hezbollah become infinitely stronger.'
p568
aS'And that puts Israel, the United States, and all of our moderate Arab friends at a distinct strategic disadvantage.'
p569
aS'Do we have a dog in this fight?'
p570
aS'You better believe we have a dog in this fight.'
p571
aS'Nigel and I support what President Obama has been trying to do, what the United Kingdom government has been trying to do, the coalition of countries: the United States, the European countries, Turkey, nearly all the Arab countries, supported by Israel -- who all want to see the following happen -- no one wants to put American troops on the ground in Syria.'
p572
aS'President Obama has said resolutely he wont do that.'
p573
aS'But this coalition is trying to do the following.'
p574
aS"They're trying to launch an intensified international effort."
p575
aS'It has been too weak so far.'
p576
aS'It needs to be strengthened to support the moderate rebels and the majority of the Syrian population who support the rebel movement.'
p577
aS"They're trying to organize more effective humanitarian aid."
p578
aS'We the Americans have given a lot.'
p579
aS'Others need to do more.'
p580
aS'But it needs to get to the refugees.'
p581
aS"This group is trying to illuminate -- for international judgment and inspection -- Assad's war crimes, his brutalization of his own people and his use of chemical weapons."
p582
aS'And this coalition as well, is seeking now to build a transitional government -- formed by the rebel movement -- that would be a government that can compete with the Assad regime for political support through which we can give humanitarian aid.'
p583
aS"And President Obama's former Syria coordinator, Fred Hoff, testified before Congress on July 17th that that should be now the central objective of this coalition."
p584
aS"They want to support a political process that eventually -- over time -- and it's going to take a long time -- to make sure that Assad can leave, that a new and more stable transitional government can take his place."
p585
aS"It won't be perfect."
p586
aS"They'll go through all sorts of ups and downs and frustrations."
p587
aS"But at the end of the day -- and maybe it's a year or two or three from now -- there's a better, more humane government in power in Damascus."
p588
aS'What are the advantages to what President Obama is trying to do?'
p589
aS'It helps the refugees.'
p590
aS'It supports the great majority of the population in Syria who are opposed to Assad.'
p591
aS'It has wide international support.'
p592
aS'It opposes Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.'
p593
aS"It has America leading -- but politically, keeping our troops out of harm's way."
p594
aS'This is going to be difficult.'
p595
aS"It's going to be enormously complex."
p596
aS"I think we'll see a lot of setbacks."
p597
aS"It is not - - and I'm sure Graham or Richard will point this out -- without its risks."
p598
aS'But there is a greater risk of inaction.'
p599
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Nick Burns.'
p600
aS'Nicholas Burns The status quo is unacceptable.'
p601
aS"I've got 30 seconds?"
p602
aS'John Donvan No, no.'
p603
aS'No.'
p604
aS'The -- Nicholas Burns The status quo is -- John Donvan Oh, you do.'
p605
aS'I apologize.'
p606
aS'Nicholas Burns Thank you.'
p607
aS'Thank you, John.'
p608
aS'John Donvan You know, now you got 45 seconds.'
p609
aS"Nicholas Burns We concede back the eight seconds of the -- the status quo here that I've just described -- is unacceptable for Americans."
p610
aS'We cannot stand by and let this happen.'
p611
aS'No American troops on the ground.'
p612
aS'But yes to America having a dog in this fight.'
p613
aS'Thank you.'
p614
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Nick Burns.'
p615
aS'The jury will disregard my interruption of Nick Burns.'
p616
aS'I apologize.'
p617
aS"I'm sorry."
p618
aS'I confused myself with that seven minute clock before.'
p619
aS'So, a reminder of where we are.'
p620
aS'We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p621
aS"I'm John Donvan."
p622
aS'We have four debaters.'
p623
aS'Two teams of two.'
p624
aS'Fighting it out over this motion -- The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p625
aS"You've heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third."
p626
aS'Speaking in support of the motion, that the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria, I want to introduce Richard Falkenrath.'
p627
aS'He is a principal with the Chertoff Group, adjunct Senior Fellow for counterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations.'
p628
aS'Former deputy homeland security adviser.'
p629
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Falkenrath.'
p630
aS'Richard Falkenrath Thank you, John.'
p631
aS'I must just start by saying, this is an immensely difficult and tragic problem.'
p632
aS"And it's very hard to take clear positions when something is so difficult and hard to solve."
p633
aS'I will say, however, that there are some things that divide the two sides of the debate.'
p634
aS'And one, as my colleague Graham said, is really what it means to have a dog in the fight.'
p635
aS'And we stand for a view which says it means you have a vital and national interest at stake which makes it so compelling that you lead and do whatever is necessary to make sure that your vital interests are protected.'
p636
aS"And we don't think that exists in Syria."
p637
aS'Graham made the case in summary for us.'
p638
aS'There are many things that we are doing as a country, that we could do, that we should do.'
p639
aS'We heard some of those from Nick.'
p640
aS'We may hear some more from Nigel.'
p641
aS'But the real question before us is is the interest engaged in Syria so vital that we must lead and be centrally involved and possibly intervene militarily to remove Assad from power?'
p642
aS'And we think the answer to that, unfortunately, is no.'
p643
aS'Graham made the argument in summary.'
p644
aS'I want to elaborate it in three ways.'
p645
aS'First, to give you a little bit of ground truth about this conflict.'
p646
aS'Second, talk about chemical weapons.'
p647
aS'And third, the issue of supplying light arms.'
p648
aS'On the ground truth in the conflict -- this is not a simple conflict of good versus evil, though Assad certainly is evil.'
p649
aS'And it is not a single conflict.'
p650
aS'This is many different conflicts.'
p651
aS"And frankly, a fatal flaw in Nick and Nigel's position here is there is no opposition for us to support."
p652
aS"You'd think that if you had a dog in the fight, you could at least have a name for the dog on the other side."
p653
aS"But it's not good enough to say the Syrian people or the Syrian opposition, because the fact is, there is no unified opposition."
p654
aS'And there is no connection between the mostly exile-based political leadership and the fighters on the ground.'
p655
aS"I -- we're so draconian on time."
p656
aS"I can't really go through all the different factions of Syrian fighters and political entities at the moment."
p657
aS"But there's the Syrian Free Army, the Syrian Liberation Front, the Syrian Islamic Front, the Al-Nusra Front, various Kurdish groups, independent groups -- all of whom are, in fact, umbrella groups of smaller numbers of fighters out there in the field running their own operations."
p658
aS'And in that context, we -- there are also organizers, The National Coalition, who are mostly outside of the country, not connected to the fighters on the inside, and not able to dictate what happens on the ground.'
p659
aS'And so, this is a real problem.'
p660
aS'If you want to have a dog in the fight, to not have the slightest idea who it is, and to hope that it will come together.'
p661
aS'And in fact, the most effective and vicious and aggressive fighters in this conflict are ones with whom we would never side.'
p662
aS'The one -- the last one I mentioned was the Al-Nusra front.'
p663
aS'This is a wing of Al-Qaeda.'
p664
aS'It has sworn allegiance to Ayman Zawahiri.'
p665
aS'So, yes, we -- now, so we have -- we really have two dilemmas in Syria.'
p666
aS"We've got Assad aligned with Hezbollah, a Shi'ite extremist terrorist group."
p667
aS"And the most effective and operationally effective opposition group being one who is completely anathema to us to the point that we've designated them a foreign terrorist organization."
p668
aS"So, how can you have a dog in the fight when you can't even identify the dog?"
p669
aS'Second, on chemical weapons -- Assad has a massive chemical weapons arsenal -- comprised primarily of nerve gas -- sarin, DX, and mustard gas.'
p670
aS"Can't go into the details of what it is, where it is."
p671
aS"It's not in a condition that can be easily and quickly used, but it is very dangerous."
p672
aS'One of the dilemmas we face here is that it is currently controlled by the Assad regime and the Alawite sect.'
p673
aS'And we do have -- maybe a vital interest -- certainly a very strong interest in ensuring these weapons are not transferred to Hezbollah and they are not used against Israel, Turkey, our allies in the Gulf, our own forces.'
p674
aS'And unfortunately, this is actually a sort of restraint on our power.'
p675
aS'Most of the more aggressive forms of intervention and keeping the military balance in the favor of the rebels will lead -- at least temporarily -- to a loss -- a higher risk of loss of control of the chemical weapons.'
p676
aS'We cannot forget that.'
p677
aS"Finally, on -- and I want to say something about what I'd call the moral hazard of half- measures."
p678
aS'We have -- as an unfortunate leitmotif in American foreign policy -- which is every so often, we give support and comfort to groups with which to rise up against an autocrat.'
p679
aS'And then we get cold feet and leave them dangling.'
p680
aS'And we did that in Hungary in 1956.'
p681
aS"We did it in the Bay of Pigs in '61, in Prague in 1968, in southern Iraq in 1991."
p682
aS'And we need to be very careful about small half measures in steps which are -- really have no prospect of success but do make us complicit in the violent outcome which we really cannot control and cannot dictate.'
p683
aS"And so for that reason it strikes me as that, yes, of course, we should stay involved and engaged diplomatically, and politically there is room for that, but to begin a process of arming a number of rebel groups we can't even control, and don't know, and, frankly, don't trust, I think, is a very dangerous first step since we really are not ready to go the distance."
p684
aS'And, in fact, very few people, and certainly none of them on this panel I think, are truly ready to go the distance, which, by the way, we all would be if it were a vital national interest.'
p685
aS"And that's the essence of the problem here."
p686
aS'We want to make it better but it really is not so vital to allow us to be ready to do everything it takes to get the outcome that would be better for us and the region.'
p687
aS'Thank you.'
p688
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Richard Falkenrath.'
p689
aS'Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p690
aS'And here to speak as our final opening statement debater against the motion, Nigel Sheinwald.'
p691
aS'He served as British ambassador to the U.S. and as foreign policy and defense advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair.'
p692
aS'Ladies and gentleman, Nigel Sheinwald.'
p693
aS'Nigel Sheinwald Well, thank you very much, John, and my thanks to Intelligence Squared for initiating an important debate.'
p694
aS"And it's a great honor for me to be here with my three distinguished fellow panelists."
p695
aS'Now, I just want to go back to the motion.'
p696
aS"I'm a Brit, and I think I know something about the English language."
p697
aS'And to me having no dog in the fight in Syria means something very simple.'
p698
aS"It means that you don't -- you're not concerned."
p699
aS"You don't have an interest, and you won't be affected by the outcome."
p700
aS"That's my dictionary definition, and I think if you look it up, that's what you'll find."
p701
aS'I agree that the other side want to do something in Syria.'
p702
aS'The question is, "How important is this issue?'
p703
aS"How much does it affect American interests, European interests, world interests, and is there some sensible way through in a world where things are much more complicated than they were in 1990 when we had the Kuwait conflict, where we have to deal in gray as much as in black and white, and where we risk paralysis if we don't try to do something rather than be paralyzed."
p704
aS'So my suggestion would be that the United States does indeed have a strategic interest in what happens in Syria.'
p705
aS"I don't know that I can meet the very high bar that Graham and our other colleague have mentioned in relation to an American intervention, whether this is important or not."
p706
aS'And the proposers of this motion do want America to stand back.'
p707
aS"I would say that in today's world you're dealing with complex changes within countries, you're dealing with situations of extremism, instability, you're dealing with a humanitarian tragedy here in Syria, and you have to work out whether there's some recipe which has a reasonable chance of success."
p708
aS'And the best need not be the enemy of the good in deciding that.'
p709
aS"I don't think, too, that we can wait for the perfect opposition party, some Jeffersonian democratic ideal to be formed in Syria."
p710
aS"We don't have perfect opposition parties in our own countries, let alone in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East."
p711
aS"We've got to go with the situation on the ground in the Middle East at the moment, where there is a huge amount of uncertainty, and we have to decide whether we understand that dictators like Assad will at some point or other be swept away."
p712
aS'And whether were prepared just to sit it out, and do very little to achieve a much better outcome.'
p713
aS'As Nick said earlier, the status quo really isnt sustainable for the United States, for Britain, and for our other allies, and thats where I really part company with Graham and with Richard.'
p714
aS'If Assad stays in power, Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah are going to win.'
p715
aS'The vast majority of the Syrian population are going to be in revolt.'
p716
aS'The longer this goes on the conflict in Syria is going to spill over into the rest of the region.'
p717
aS'The split between the Sunni and the Shia within Islam is going to expand.'
p718
aS"And speaking certainly for my country, we've seen a radicalization of our Muslim population because of Syria."
p719
aS"It's become a recruiting sergeant for radicals around the world."
p720
aS'And those young men and perhaps women are going to go to Syria and pick up a whole load of skills in violence and in terrorism, which will be re-imported into our own countries and threaten us very directly.'
p721
aS"And I think that's a real risk for the U.K., for the U.S., and for others."
p722
aS'I spent nearly 36 years in the British diplomatic service.'
p723
aS'I believe in the transatlantic partnership.'
p724
aS"I think that there's little good that happens in the world if Europe and America are not standing together."
p725
aS'And I and my compatriots are friends of this country.'
p726
aS"But I do worry about America's credibility and standing if we just sit this one out."
p727
aS'President Obama talked last year about red lines and a game changer if Syria were found to have used chemical weapons.'
p728
aS'We now know that chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime in the conflict.'
p729
aS'This administration, my government, many other governments have said unequivocally over the months that Assad must go.'
p730
aS'So what happens if he stays?'
p731
aS'Is that without any consequence?'
p732
aS'At the very least Iran is going to be watching and is going to draw a conclusion about American resolve and determination.'
p733
aS'Russia and China will be watching.'
p734
aS"If this audience wants to sustain American leadership of a new kind after the difficult decade that we've had, then I think we need an active, concerted, comprehensive policy in Syria, and not be defeated by the fear that anything we do will suck us in militarily."
p735
aS'And as Nick has said, that does not need to happen.'
p736
aS"We've got a program which addresses the humanitarian problem, which accepts that this opposition is not perfect, but there is a national coalition which has formed, which -- with which the U.S. government recognizes as the alternative government of Syria, which the European governments and Arab League governments see in that role as well."
p737
aS"And there are still moderate rebel forces in the form of the Free Syria -- channel arms through as a way of changing the situation on the ground, which is what we've got to do."
p738
aS'Assad will not move by himself.'
p739
aS'It will require persistent determined pressure over a range of areas, diplomatic, humanitarian, and then with these limited arms supplies from the United States and indeed from other Arab countries.'
p740
aS'So to my mind that is a dog in the fight.'
p741
aS"That's a strategic stake for the United States and for Britain and we've got to support this trend in the Arab world and we've got to support the Syrian people."
p742
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Nigel Sheinwald.'
p743
aS'Your time is up.'
p744
aS'Ladies and gentleman, Nigel Sheinwald.'
p745
aS'And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being debated is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p746
aS"Remember, you voted before the debate and you will vote again once after the debate, after you've heard the arguments and the team who has won more percentage points of your support when the debate is over will be declared our winner."
p747
aS'Now on to round two.'
p748
aS'Round two is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me.'
p749
aS'We have two teams of two arguing out this motion, The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p750
aS'Graham Allison and Richard Falkenrath are arguing in support of the motion, no dog in the fight.'
p751
aS"They argue that Syria just does not represent a vital U.S. interest, that the U.S. has no options before it that can lead to a desirable solution or a solution that would actually improve the problem, that there is no dog to pick in that fight, that the opposition fighting Assad is so fractured that it's difficult to know who should get the arms and a lot of them are people who would not end up being our friends."
p752
aS'They say this is not one where the U.S. should be leading.'
p753
aS'Their opponents, Nick Burns and Nigel Sheinwald, say this is one where absolutely the U.S. must lead.'
p754
aS'The U.S. cannot sit this out, that it has a moral and pragmatic imperative to get involved for humanitarian reasons, for political reasons.'
p755
aS'They say that if Assad wins our allies in the region are really going to be in trouble, and they say there is a political process already in place that represents the dog that the U.S. can ride on this, and should ride all the way.'
p756
aS'They are hopeful that it will ultimately produce results.'
p757
aS'I want to put a question to the side thats arguing that the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria.'
p758
aS'It looks as though what we have here basically to some degree is a disagreement about definition of terms.'
p759
aS'You have talked about not having a vital interest in getting involved in Syria, and I want to put to you the question, just I think this allows us to go to some specifics, to look at some of whats actually happening there, and ask you to tell us why thats not vital.'
p760
aS'For example, as your opponents have pointed out, if Syria melts away as a state, even if -- with or without Assad, if it ends up being a chaotic place fueling and inviting a radicalization of a generation who would be our enemies, who would end up coming to this country with weapons, doing bad things to us, how is that not a vital interest, and why isnt it?'
p761
aS'Graham Allison.'
p762
aS'Graham Allison A very good question.'
p763
aS'I think the U.S. is a global power.'
p764
aS"And I think -- if I go back to Nigel's point just for a second -- the -- I think you set up a bit of a straw dog with the -- with respect."
p765
aS"The notion that there's anywhere we don't care about -- excuse me, we care about things in 200 countries today."
p766
aS'Things happening everywhere impact U.S. interests.'
p767
aS"We don't sit with indifference for Sudan, for Somalia, for Pakistan, for Iraq, for any of the dozen wars that are going on now."
p768
aS'But because the ability of U.S. -- both in terms of mind share and also capabilities is limited -- about each case, your question, John, is right -- the very right question.'
p769
aS'If Syria melts down and comes to be three states or more chaotic than it is today, will this be horrible?'
p770
aS'Yes.'
p771
aS'Will it have bigger impacts on U.S. interests?'
p772
aS'Of course.'
p773
aS'Does it rise to the level of vital -- if this -- John Donvan Well, does it rise to -- Graham Allison -- such that -- John Donvan Does it rise to the -- does it rise to the level of justifying intervention?'
p774
aS"Graham Allison That's right."
p775
aS"John Donvan And you're saying it doesn't."
p776
aS'Why not?'
p777
aS"Graham Allison Does it rise to a level of concern that would lead -- that would compel a responsible government to intervene militarily -- if that's the only way to resolve the issue?"
p778
aS'And I would say the answer is no.'
p779
aS'If Syria melts down, this will be horrible.'
p780
aS'It will have impacts on Lebanon, and on -- and on Iraq, of course.'
p781
aS"It'll exacerbate the Sunni-Shi'ite division."
p782
aS'Of course.'
p783
aS'All those things are also happening before Syria.'
p784
aS'John Donvan Could you -- Graham Allison If Syria -- John Donvan Could you take -- I want to go to the other side, first, Richard.'
p785
aS"But I just want to ask Graham -- just take 15 seconds -- what would represent a threat to America's vital interests?"
p786
aS'Just to put the marker out there.'
p787
aS'Graham Allison Yeah.'
p788
aS'If we look to the year ahead, Iran getting nuclear weapons.'
p789
aS'John Donvan Okay.'
p790
aS"Let's go to the other side."
p791
aS'Who would like to respond?'
p792
aS'Nick Burns or Nigel Sheinwald?'
p793
aS'Nick Burns.'
p794
aS'Nicholas Burns Well, I just say this.'
p795
aS'The question is -- who has a dog in the fight in Syria?'
p796
aS'Do we have one?'
p797
aS'Do we care who wins and loses?'
p798
aS"John Donvan Well, Nigel, can you -- you've -- I'm sorry."
p799
aS'Nick, you made that point in your opening.'
p800
aS"I just want to see if you can respond to -- Nicholas Burns I'm responding to -- I'm responding right now."
p801
aS'John Donvan Yeah.'
p802
aS'All right.'
p803
aS'Sounds very familiar.'
p804
aS'Nicholas Burns Good.'
p805
aS'You try to repeat your major themes.'
p806
aS'John Donvan All right.'
p807
aS'Fair enough.'
p808
aS"I'm really not trying to clash with you, and I -- All right."
p809
aS'Nicholas Burns We want you on our side, John.'
p810
aS'John Donvan Okay.'
p811
aS"Nicholas Burns I was addressing Graham's point."
p812
aS'And, you know, we are good friends and colleagues.'
p813
aS'And I think that Graham and Richard have raised some really important points.'
p814
aS'This is not an easy choice.'
p815
aS"In fact, it's really difficult."
p816
aS'And generally, in my career, John, this answers the question.'
p817
aS"American presidents do not put American troops into harm's way unless it's a vital interest."
p818
aS"But that's not what President Obama's trying to do."
p819
aS"He's not trying to put American troops into Syria."
p820
aS"In fact, he said he won't."
p821
aS"And Nigel and I are just arguing, because of the humanitarian interest, because of where Syria is, its proximity to Israel and other countries, because of the imminent victory of Iran in a major power play, we need to be active with President Obama's plan."
p822
aS"But it doesn't have anything to do with vital."
p823
aS'And vital is not in that question.'
p824
aS'John Donvan And I think the key disagreement -- and both sides use this word -- was the word lead.'
p825
aS'And this side said this is not one where the U.S. needs to lead.'
p826
aS"This side says the U.S. needs to lead and quoting you, Nigel Sheinwald, you can't sit this out."
p827
aS'So, I want to take that back to Richard Falkenrath.'
p828
aS'This question of leadership.'
p829
aS"Richard Falkenrath There's a lot of information that's coming out of Syria now, about what the people engaged are suffering from this fighting."
p830
aS"Actually, I think -- and as far as they're concerned, we're sitting this one out."
p831
aS"I mean, there's -- there is -- they're very clear, the reporting out of Syria is the U.S. is having no impact on the ground."
p832
aS'In fact, the narrative looks more like Al-Qaeda is having an impact and Hezbollah is having an impact.'
p833
aS'But we are not.'
p834
aS'The -- it strikes me, as you kn0w, President Obama is stuck with no good options.'
p835
aS'And this will go down in history as a failure of his policy.'
p836
aS"But he's confronted only with options which make the failure even worse, because in order to really make an impact here, we have to make a difference on the ground."
p837
aS"It's not enough to figure out who to write a check to or ship a bunch of light arms to."
p838
aS"You have to figure out, who are we tipping the military balance in favor of so that there's a better outcome at the end."
p839
aS'And we are not doing that at this time.'
p840
aS"John Donvan But with your -- I don't want to say approval -- but you think that's the right choice at this point?"
p841
aS'Richard Falkenrath Yes.'
p842
aS'John Donvan Okay.'
p843
aS"Let's take it back to Nigel Sheinwald."
p844
aS"Nigel Sheinwald Well, I -- John Donvan You're very good with the word yes."
p845
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.'
p846
aS"Nigel Sheinwald I just think that Richard's analysis is flawed and slanted in his favor, because the reality is that there is a political opposition in Syria."
p847
aS"It's fragmented, but there is a central group that's all of us in the United States, in Europe, in the Arab League are supporting and recognize an alternative government."
p848
aS'And there is a group called the Free Syrian Army that can channel arms and it could conceivably tip the balance quite quickly.'
p849
aS"Just this week we've seen examples of the attempted assassination of Assad."
p850
aS"I'm not recommending that."
p851
aS'But it happened.'
p852
aS"And we've seen continued taking of territory by the moderate and recognized groups."
p853
aS'I accept that there is Al-Qaeda involved.'
p854
aS'There are a whole bunch of other groups involved.'
p855
aS"But that's been the situation throughout the Middle East over the past couple of years."
p856
aS"And in all those other areas, we haven't said that the Tunisian president must stay."
p857
aS"We haven't said that Gadhafi must stay."
p858
aS"We haven't said that Mubarak must stay."
p859
aS"We couldn't say that and accept that the will of those people is just going to be completely ignored."
p860
aS"And that's what worries me about our opponents' position, that they are really arguing an old-fashioned view of realpolitik."
p861
aS"Keeping someone in power because it's the easiest option."
p862
aS'John Donvan All right.'
p863
aS'Let me -- Nigel, let me just interrupt you to give Graham a chance to respond to some of your earlier points.'
p864
aS'So, Graham Allison.'
p865
aS'Graham Allison Yeah.'
p866
aS"I think your -- Nigel, what you're saying is persuasive."
p867
aS'But -- okay.'
p868
aS'The Free Syrian Army representatives and the opposition -- as Rich said -- a lot of Americans know them.'
p869
aS'These are guys that we meet in Turkey.'
p870
aS"You don't see them fighting on the ground in Syria."
p871
aS"So, they're spending their time talking to folks like us, not having any control over 1,200 different groups who are fighting independently."
p872
aS'Chairman Dempsey said last week -- in that -- or two weeks ago -- in very important testimony he says here, just a quote About six months ago, we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition.'
p873
aS"Now I want to say it's even more opaque."
p874
aS'John Donvan Okay.'
p875
aS'Nick Burns?'
p876
aS'Nicholas Burns Just to point a fact -- the Free Syrian Army is inside Syria.'
p877
aS"It's commended by General Salim Idris, our colleague David Ignatius of The Washington Post has reported on his activities there."
p878
aS"It's the National Coalition, the political group that, you know, goes around the world, raising money, trying to raise consciousness."
p879
aS"I would just say another thing about General Dempsey's testimony."
p880
aS'All true.'
p881
aS'This is going to be -- if the United States were to get involved, it would be difficult.'
p882
aS"But President Obama, his boss, is saying, We're not going to put troops on the ground."
p883
aS"So I think the real question here that I wanted to address to Rich and to Graham -- and this is hard -- is it's certainly legitimate of you to say there's a risk in what you're proposing, a risk in action."
p884
aS'But I think also the onus has to be on you to answer the question -- what is the risk of inaction?'
p885
aS'If we do nothing, do we suffer?'
p886
aS'Do American strategic interests suffer?'
p887
aS'John Donvan And I heard a little clap over there.'
p888
aS"That's fine, to do that."
p889
aS"So -- and again, as I said earlier, because we're a radio broadcast, it tells the radio audience that ultimately will hear this that you're all here."
p890
aS"So -- -- you don't have to overdo it, but it's not like a presidential debate, where you're not allowed and you have to sit on your hands."
p891
aS"So -- just so, that's fine."
p892
aS"But it's a great question."
p893
aS"And I think it's one we all want to actually hear this side answer."
p894
aS'What is the -- what are the consequences of inaction?'
p895
aS"Now, you've said already you don't think they're vital."
p896
aS'But what are they?'
p897
aS'Richard Falkenrath.'
p898
aS"Richard Falkenrath Well, first, it's not as though we're inactive."
p899
aS"We're doing something."
p900
aS"It's just not making any difference."
p901
aS"And there's two halves -- -- and this has been the case for a long time."
p902
aS'I mean, this has been -- how long ago was it that President Obama said he needs to go?'
p903
aS'Assad needs to go?'
p904
aS"But there's two halves of the argument."
p905
aS'The first is about vital national interests.'
p906
aS"And I think -- it seems to us that you agree with us, that it -- we haven't met that bar."
p907
aS"But there's a second half, which is, you need to reasonably articulate a plan that gets you to a better place when you're done."
p908
aS"And if you're unable to do that, then you are, by default, stuck with the bad consequences of inaction or of a policy that really isn't making much difference."
p909
aS'And so, it -- in fact, the onus is on you to articulate an alternative plan that gets us somewhere -- when -- -- the interestingly -- you know, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just testified to this effect for his confirmation hearing.'
p910
aS"And he basically said there isn't one."
p911
aS'And he was -- he went through six different options.'
p912
aS'And he said, all of them -- none of them work.'
p913
aS'John Donvan Nigel Sheinwald.'
p914
aS'Nigel Sheinwald All of them are problematic.'
p915
aS'But of course, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs supports the limited supply of arms to the Syrian rebels that the president has authorized.'
p916
aS'So, he believes that that is a reasonable policy choice, which will not drag America in in the way that the other policy options he analyzed might.'
p917
aS"Now, I think the issue is, is this any different from the other situations we've seen in the Middle East?"
p918
aS'All very difficult.'
p919
aS'And in Tunisia, you saw a messy political protests leading to an election and the election of a moderate Islamist group.'
p920
aS'In Libya, everyone rightly said, was chaos.'
p921
aS'But there was a transition process.'
p922
aS'There were elections, again, with a moderate Islamist group elected.'
p923
aS"It's still very chaotic in Libya, but we're all going to have to live with 10 or 20 years of unwinding of this extraordinary set of events in the Middle East."
p924
aS"We can't wait for that perfect moment to arrive."
p925
aS'John Donvan I want to put a question back to this side.'
p926
aS'It\'s saying that this -- U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria, the question was put to you, "What will be the consequences of inaction?'
p927
aS'" You parried with a question back to the other side.'
p928
aS'I allowed it to go.'
p929
aS'But I really want to know what your answer to the question is, the consequences of inaction.'
p930
aS"Let's take a specific your opponents put to you, not rescuing this humanitarian crisis."
p931
aS'Nigel Sheinwald in his opening statement said, "This is just going to look real bad.'
p932
aS'" We talked, I mentioned earlier, Rwanda, great regret about that.'
p933
aS"Is it not significantly harmful to American interests and reputation not to be acting in the case of the Syrian refugees and the killing that's going on there?"
p934
aS'Graham Allison And the answer is, of course it is.'
p935
aS'John Donvan Graham Allison.'
p936
aS'Graham Allison And of course the U.S. is acting.'
p937
aS"I mean, let's be clear."
p938
aS'Who is the largest supporter of humanitarian assistance to Syria today?'
p939
aS'The U.S. President Obama announced last week another $195 million.'
p940
aS'We have a billion dollars, and we should be doing much more, and we should be raising much more from other parties.'
p941
aS'John Donvan But, Graham, the -- Graham Allison that -- John Donvan -- I think the sense of the question is not strictly about blankets and tents.'
p942
aS"I think part of the question is bringing back, say, for example, the example of Bosnia where a refugee crisis -- in addition to other things -- but a refugee crisis prompted very, very aggressive American action not just in the -- Graham Allison I think that's a good analogy, and I think in that instance there were very special circumstances."
p943
aS'Nick has actually written about this.'
p944
aS'And he and I agree on this.'
p945
aS'There were very special circumstances in which a limited U.S. military intervention made the difference at the margin to get to a better place.'
p946
aS'And I think that was a good example.'
p947
aS'In this instance, why is it different?'
p948
aS'We have an old professor that used to make a list where you draw it down the middle of the page, you say, "Similar," and "Different.'
p949
aS'" The similarities in this case are superficial.'
p950
aS'The differences are profound.'
p951
aS'John Donvan Nick Burns.'
p952
aS"Nicholas Burns I guess what I'm thinking is that, you know, I think President Obama is faced with a very difficult choice."
p953
aS'Part of the problem is that Assad is trying to frame the international debate, "It\'s me against the jihadists.'
p954
aS"You Americans don't have a dog in the fight."
p955
aS'" Actually, if you listen to the Iranians and listen to Russia, that\'s exactly what they\'re saying, "Stay out, you don\'t have an interest.'
p956
aS'" What we\'re saying is, "We\'re facing a complex environment there.'
p957
aS'There are al-Qaeda groups, and there are jihadi groups.'
p958
aS'" And Richard knows more about this than anybody, he\'s right about that, but there also is the moderate element.'
p959
aS'The only way to help the refugees and people of Syria is to support that moderate element.'
p960
aS'Why should we want to see the jihadis and the Syrian government to be the only people armed?'
p961
aS'We have to give these moderate rebels a chance.'
p962
aS"That's the basis of President Obama's policy, which we support."
p963
aS'John Donvan Richard Falkenrath.'
p964
aS'Richard, can you hold for just one second?'
p965
aS"After Richard speaks, I'd like to go to the audience to begin getting questions from you."
p966
aS'What will happen is the house lights will come up.'
p967
aS"If you raise your hand I'll call on you."
p968
aS'A mic will be brought to you if you could stand up.'
p969
aS"You'll be recorded and filmed, so if you could just state your name and ask a question that's terse, that doesn't take more than 30 seconds or so, that really keeps on point, that gets these teams to debate on this matter."

S'So thank you very much, John.'
p1017
aS"And it's an honor for Rich and I to appear even in adebate with two such distinguished colleagues."
p1018
aS'But I want to warn you at the outsetthat this is a bit of a mismatch.'
p1019
aS'Rich and I are academics and think tank types.'
p1020
aS"Nick andNigel are two of the most effective public advocates we've seen in recent times.Nick is one of my colleagues and friends at Harvard, our offices are about 20 feet apart."
p1021
aS'Iintroduce him as often as I can to Harvard audiences because I would prefer him tospeak than me.'
p1022
aS'And always I say, which is what I truly believe, that the U.S. has had nomore effective public spokesman in modern times than Nick Burns when he wasassistant secretary for public affairs.'
p1023
aS'Nigel is a legend --Nigel is a legend in Washington as the British ambassador to the U.S., who is an [[applause]] extremely, again, effective public spokesman.'
p1024
aS"So as you listen to the discussion tonight, Ihope you'll think about the evidence and the analysis presented and not the eloquencebecause if ---- if that was the case, you can vote now and be done."
p1025
aS'[[laughter]] So the motion is about a dog in the fight.'
p1026
aS'Let me just ask, how many people here have a [[laughter]] dog?'
p1027
aS'Okay.'
p1028
aS"So I just want to see if it's a dog friendly audience."
p1029
aS'I think Aspen is usuallyfairly dog friendly.'
p1030
aS'So as you think about the argument tonight, consider this, you goaround a corner, you confront dogs in a fight, and you think what to do.'
p1031
aS"And comparethat with a second case in which you're confronting a dog fight in which one dog has itsmouth around the other's throat and you discover that it's your dog."
p1032
aS'Now, the questionis, "Is this America\'s dog in this fight?'
p1033
aS'" So as the moderator reminded us, thisassignment tonight is not whether the U.S. should care about the dogs that are tearingeach other apart in Syria tonight.It\'s tragic and anybody who looks at it without having their heart torn ought to have a --you know, an MRI to see if their heart\'s turned to stone.'
p1034
aS'The question is, "How muchshould we care and what should we do about it?'
p1035
aS'" So in the language of nationalsecurity, the question is, "Does what\'s happening in Syria so impact American vitalnational interests that we\'re compelled to do everything we can including militaryactions to secure our interests?'
p1036
aS'" That\'s what it is to have a vital national interest.'
p1037
aS'And,secondly, if the answer to that is, "Yes," or even if you\'re a little shaky on that one, "Hasanybody been able to identify a feasible American military intervention that would likelymake the situation better over the long run than -- after we had acted than in the casewe did not act?'
p1038
aS'"So if you think about this be clear and let me be as unambiguous as we can.'
p1039
aS'Our answerto these questions -- these two questions are no and no.'
p1040
aS"No, the U.S. does not have avital national interest in what's happening in Syria, and two, no."
p1041
aS"No one, is at least tomy satisfaction, or Rich's or indeed to Chairman Dempsey, chairman of the JCS,identified a feasible American military intervention, which after the fact would likelymake the situation over time better than the alternative."
p1042
aS"So, it's to our opponents, Ithink, to explain how and why they disagree with these judgments, and suggest to uswhat evidence leads them to that conclusion.In these opening comments, I'm going to just make some general comments -- generalbig points, big picture, that bear on the question you have in front of you, and then mycolleague, Rich, is going to drill down in more detail."
p1043
aS"Four quick points.First, Sam Nunn who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, which we're all here aspart of, insists that we draw the distinction between vivid and vital."
p1044
aS"Because he sayswhenever something is vivid, especially if it appears on TV over and over and people arebeing killed, Americans, or many Americans, imagine well, we must have a vital interestthere because it's impacting our interests and since we're the world's greatest militarysuper power, maybe there's a military intervention we could undertake to make thingsbetter."
p1045
aS"In our view, that's not the case here."
p1046
aS'This is a vivid, painful, but not vital.'
p1047
aS'Vitalin the dictionary, read it, says essential for survival and well-being.In the mantra of national security it says essential for the preservation of the U.S. as afree society with our fundamental institutions and values intact.'
p1048
aS'Syria does not meetthat test.'
p1049
aS"Now some of you are saying well, maybe that's too high a test."
p1050
aS'I mean, couldanything threaten our vital interest?'
p1051
aS"And I would say in 1990, when Saddam tried toannex Kuwait and threatened the whole possibility of the flow of oil from the PersianGulf, President Bush, the father, chose military action and that was the right choice.John DonvanGraham Allison, I'm sorry, your introductory remark time is up and concluded."
p1052
aS'Thankyou very much, Graham Allison.John Donvan [[applause]] I want to point out our introductory remarks last six minutes each.'
p1053
aS'I gave Graham sevenbecause he spent the first time saying such nice things about the other side, and --although it might have been a sneak attack.'
p1054
aS"I'm not sure.Also, your timers will say six minutes from this point forward."
p1055
aS'Our motion is: The U.S. [[laughter]] Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria, and here to speak against the motion is our nextdebater, Nick Burns.'
p1056
aS"He's professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of theAspen Strategy Group, and former undersecretary of state for political affairs."
p1057
aS'Ladiesand gentleman, Nicholas Burns.Nicholas Burns [[applause]] John, thank you very much.'
p1058
aS'Good afternoon everyone.'
p1059
aS"It's a pleasure to be here."
p1060
aS'Pleasure for Nigel and I to be with Richard and Graham.'
p1061
aS"They're both good friends."
p1062
aS"Iwon't try to butter them up anymore."
p1063
aS'I need my time, but I will say this.'
p1064
aS"We've beenasked to address one question."
p1065
aS'Does the United States of America have a dog in thefight in Syria?'
p1066
aS"The question wasn't whether it's vital."
p1067
aS"The question wasn't whether it'sfeasible."
p1068
aS'Do we have an interest in who wins in this fight in Syria?'
p1069
aS'And the answer isunequivocally of course, yes, without any question.'
p1070
aS"Because Americans should besupporting the Syrian people who have been brutalized by the Syrian dictatorship ofBashar al-Assad.And we should oppose the Assad regime because it's being supported by Iran andHezbollah and Russia."
p1071
aS"So that's the dog in the fight for the United States."
p1072
aS'And whathappens in Syria really matters to our country for our national security.'
p1073
aS'I would say itmatters to every American.'
p1074
aS"Let me give you three reasons why.First, there's a humanitarian imperative."
p1075
aS"I think everybody knows what's beenhappening."
p1076
aS"There's a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria."
p1077
aS'More than 100,000Syrians have been killed in the last two and a half years, all civilians, 1.8 million Syrianrefugees outside the country in Iraq and Turkey and in Jordan in refugee camps, 6.8million people in need of humanitarian support and of those people, 4.5 million havelost their home in Syria.'
p1078
aS"They're on the roads."
p1079
aS"They're trying to find a place to live."
p1080
aS"They've lost their jobs.Secretary of State -- former Secretary of State Madeline Albright is here."
p1081
aS'And she and Iwere in Morocco a couple of months ago.'
p1082
aS'We met with the U.N.'
p1083
aS'Envoy for Syria, LakhdarBrahimi.'
p1084
aS"He told us something I don't think -- I won't forget."
p1085
aS'It was very arresting.'
p1086
aS'Hesaid, Syria is melting away because of this humanitarian crisis.'
p1087
aS'So, do we have a dog inthe fight?'
p1088
aS'We want to help the Syrian people who have been brutalized by their ownregime.'
p1089
aS"That's the first reason."
p1090
aS'The second reason is geography.'
p1091
aS'Look at the map.'
p1092
aS'Syria isa neighbor to very important friends and allies of the United States.'
p1093
aS"It's a neighbor toIsrael."
p1094
aS"It's a neighbor to Turkey, to Iraq, to Jordan, and to Lebanon."
p1095
aS'So, its centralstrategic position in the Levant, in the heart of the Middle East, in the heart of the Arabworld -- it means that what happens there really matters to the United States andespecially to our ally, Israel.And third, Syria matters to the United States because who is arming and aiding andfinancing this regime?'
p1096
aS"It's our enemy, Iran."
p1097
aS'And its partner Hezbollah.'
p1098
aS"And it's ouradversary, Russia."
p1099
aS'So, if Assad wins, Iran and Hezbollah become infinitely stronger.'
p1100
aS'Andthat puts Israel, the United States, and all of our moderate Arab friends at a distinctstrategic disadvantage.'
p1101
aS'Do we have a dog in this fight?'
p1102
aS'You better believe we have a dogin this fight.'
p1103
aS'Nigel and I support what President Obama has been trying to do, what theUnited Kingdom government has been trying to do, the coalition of countries: theUnited States, the European countries, Turkey, nearly all the Arab countries, supportedby Israel -- who all want to see the following happen -- no one wants to put Americantroops on the ground in Syria.'
p1104
aS'President Obama has said resolutely he wont do that.'
p1105
aS'Butthis coalition is trying to do the following.'
p1106
aS"They're trying to launch an intensifiedinternational effort."
p1107
aS'It has been too weak so far.It needs to be strengthened to support the moderate rebels and the majority of theSyrian population who support the rebel movement.'
p1108
aS"They're trying to organize moreeffective humanitarian aid."
p1109
aS'We the Americans have given a lot.'
p1110
aS'Others need to do more.But it needs to get to the refugees.'
p1111
aS"This group is trying to illuminate -- for internationaljudgment and inspection -- Assad's war crimes, his brutalization of his own people andhis use of chemical weapons.And this coalition as well, is seeking now to build a transitional government -- formed bythe rebel movement -- that would be a government that can compete with the Assadregime for political support through which we can give humanitarian aid."
p1112
aS"And PresidentObama's former Syria coordinator, Fred Hoff, testified before Congress on July 17th thatthat should be now the central objective of this coalition."
p1113
aS"They want to support apolitical process that eventually -- over time -- and it's going to take a long time -- tomake sure that Assad can leave, that a new and more stable transitional governmentcan take his place.It won't be perfect."
p1114
aS"They'll go through all sorts of ups and downs and frustrations."
p1115
aS"But atthe end of the day -- and maybe it's a year or two or three from now -- there's a better,more humane government in power in Damascus.What are the advantages to what President Obama is trying to do?"
p1116
aS'It helps the refugees.It supports the great majority of the population in Syria who are opposed to Assad.'
p1117
aS'Ithas wide international support.'
p1118
aS'It opposes Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.'
p1119
aS"It has Americaleading -- but politically, keeping our troops out of harm's way."
p1120
aS'This is going to bedifficult.'
p1121
aS"It's going to be enormously complex."
p1122
aS"I think we'll see a lot of setbacks."
p1123
aS"It is not -- and I'm sure Graham or Richard will point this out -- without its risks."
p1124
aS'But there is agreater risk of inaction.John DonvanThank you, Nick Burns.Nicholas BurnsThe status quo is unacceptable.'
p1125
aS"I've got 30 seconds?John DonvanNo, no."
p1126
aS'No.'
p1127
aS'The --Nicholas BurnsThe status quo is --John DonvanOh, you do.'
p1128
aS'I apologize.Nicholas BurnsThank you.Thank you, John.'
p1129
aS"[[laughter]] John DonvanYou know, now you got 45 seconds.Nicholas BurnsWe concede back the eight seconds of the -- the status quo here that I've just described-- is unacceptable for Americans."
p1130
aS'We cannot stand by and let this happen.'
p1131
aS'No Americantroops on the ground.'
p1132
aS'But yes to America having a dog in this fight.'
p1133
aS'Thank you.John DonvanThank you, Nick Burns.The jury will disregard my interruption of Nick Burns.'
p1134
aS'I apologize.'
p1135
aS"I'm sorry."
p1136
aS'I confused [[applause]] myself with that seven minute clock before.'
p1137
aS'So, a reminder of where we are.'
p1138
aS'We arehalfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p1139
aS"I'm JohnDonvan."
p1140
aS'We have four debaters.'
p1141
aS'Two teams of two.'
p1142
aS'Fighting it out over this motion --The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1143
aS"You've heard the first two debaters, and nowon to the third."
p1144
aS'Speaking in support of the motion, that the U.S. has no dog in the fightin Syria, I want to introduce Richard Falkenrath.He is a principal with the Chertoff Group, adjunct Senior Fellow for counterrorism andhomeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations.'
p1145
aS'Former deputy homelandsecurity adviser.'
p1146
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Falkenrath.Richard Falkenrath [[applause]] Thank you, John.'
p1147
aS'I must just start by saying, this is an immensely difficult and tragicproblem.'
p1148
aS"And it's very hard to take clear positions when something is so difficult andhard to solve."
p1149
aS'I will say, however, that there are some things that divide the two sides ofthe debate.'
p1150
aS'And one, as my colleague Graham said, is really what it means to have a dogin the fight.'
p1151
aS'And we stand for a view which says it means you have a vital and nationalinterest at stake which makes it so compelling that you lead and do whatever isnecessary to make sure that your vital interests are protected.'
p1152
aS"And we don't think thatexists in Syria."
p1153
aS'Graham made the case in summary for us.There are many things that we are doing as a country, that we could do, that we shoulddo.'
p1154
aS'We heard some of those from Nick.'
p1155
aS'We may hear some more from Nigel.'
p1156
aS'But thereal question before us is is the interest engaged in Syria so vital that we must lead andbe centrally involved and possibly intervene militarily to remove Assad from power?And we think the answer to that, unfortunately, is no.Graham made the argument in summary.'
p1157
aS'I want to elaborate it in three ways.'
p1158
aS'First, togive you a little bit of ground truth about this conflict.'
p1159
aS'Second, talk about chemicalweapons.'
p1160
aS'And third, the issue of supplying light arms.On the ground truth in the conflict -- this is not a simple conflict of good versus evil,though Assad certainly is evil.'
p1161
aS'And it is not a single conflict.'
p1162
aS'This is many differentconflicts.'
p1163
aS"And frankly, a fatal flaw in Nick and Nigel's position here is there is noopposition for us to support."
p1164
aS"You'd think that if you had a dog in the fight, you could atleast have a name for the dog on the other side."
p1165
aS"But it's not good enough to say theSyrian people or the Syrian opposition, because the fact is, there is no unifiedopposition.And there is no connection between the mostly exile-based political leadership and thefighters on the ground.I -- we're so draconian on time."
p1166
aS"I can't really go through all the different factions ofSyrian fighters and political entities at the moment."
p1167
aS"But there's the Syrian Free Army,the Syrian Liberation Front, the Syrian Islamic Front, the Al-Nusra Front, various Kurdishgroups, independent groups -- all of whom are, in fact, umbrella groups of smallernumbers of fighters out there in the field running their own operations."
p1168
aS'And in thatcontext, we -- there are also organizers, The National Coalition, who are mostly outsideof the country, not connected to the fighters on the inside, and not able to dictate whathappens on the ground.'
p1169
aS'And so, this is a real problem.'
p1170
aS'If you want to have a dog in thefight, to not have the slightest idea who it is, and to hope that it will come together.'
p1171
aS'Andin fact, the most effective and vicious and aggressive fighters in this conflict are oneswith whom we would never side.The one -- the last one I mentioned was the Al-Nusra front.'
p1172
aS'This is a wing of Al-Qaeda.'
p1173
aS'Ithas sworn allegiance to Ayman Zawahiri.'
p1174
aS'So, yes, we -- now, so we have -- we really havetwo dilemmas in Syria.'
p1175
aS"We've got Assad aligned with Hezbollah, a Shi'ite extremistterrorist group."
p1176
aS"And the most effective and operationally effective opposition groupbeing one who is completely anathema to us to the point that we've designated them aforeign terrorist organization."
p1177
aS"So, how can you have a dog in the fight when you can'teven identify the dog?Second, on chemical weapons -- Assad has a massive chemical weapons arsenal --comprised primarily of nerve gas -- sarin, DX, and mustard gas."
p1178
aS"Can't go into the detailsof what it is, where it is."
p1179
aS"It's not in a condition that can be easily and quickly used, but itis very dangerous."
p1180
aS'One of the dilemmas we face here is that it is currently controlled bythe Assad regime and the Alawite sect.'
p1181
aS'And we do have -- maybe a vital interest --certainly a very strong interest in ensuring these weapons are not transferred toHezbollah and they are not used against Israel, Turkey, our allies in the Gulf, our ownforces.And unfortunately, this is actually a sort of restraint on our power.'
p1182
aS'Most of the moreaggressive forms of intervention and keeping the military balance in the favor of therebels will lead -- at least temporarily -- to a loss -- a higher risk of loss of control of thechemical weapons.'
p1183
aS"We cannot forget that.Finally, on -- and I want to say something about what I'd call the moral hazard of half-measures."
p1184
aS'We have -- as an unfortunate leitmotif in American foreign policy -- which isevery so often, we give support and comfort to groups with which to rise up against anautocrat.'
p1185
aS'And then we get cold feet and leave them dangling.'
p1186
aS'And we did that inHungary in 1956.'
p1187
aS"We did it in the Bay of Pigs in '61, in Prague in 1968, in southern Iraq in1991.And we need to be very careful about small half measures in steps which are -- reallyhave no prospect of success but do make us complicit in the violent outcome which wereally cannot control and cannot dictate."
p1188
aS"And so for that reason it strikes me as that,yes, of course, we should stay involved and engaged diplomatically, and politically thereis room for that, but to begin a process of arming a number of rebel groups we can'teven control, and don't know, and, frankly, don't trust, I think, is a very dangerous firststep since we really are not ready to go the distance."
p1189
aS'And, in fact, very few people, andcertainly none of them on this panel I think, are truly ready to go the distance, which, bythe way, we all would be if it were a vital national interest.'
p1190
aS"And that's the essence of theproblem here."
p1191
aS'We want to make it better but it really is not so vital to allow us to beready to do everything it takes to get the outcome that would be better for us and theregion.'
p1192
aS'Thank you.John DonvanThank you, Richard Falkenrath.Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1193
aS'And here to speak as our final [[applause]] opening statement debater against the motion, Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1194
aS'He served as Britishambassador to the U.S. and as foreign policy and defense advisor to Prime MinisterTony Blair.'
p1195
aS'Ladies and gentleman,Nigel Sheinwald.Nigel Sheinwald [[applause]] Well, thank you very much, John, and my thanks to Intelligence Squared for initiating animportant debate.'
p1196
aS"And it's a great honor for me to be here with my three distinguishedfellow panelists."
p1197
aS'Now, I just want to go back to the motion.'
p1198
aS"I'm a Brit, and I think I knowsomething about the English language."
p1199
aS'And to me having no dog in the fight in Syriameans something very simple.'
p1200
aS"It means that you don't -- you're not concerned."
p1201
aS"Youdon't have an interest, and you won't be affected by the outcome.That's my dictionary definition, and I think if you look it up, that's what you'll find."
p1202
aS'Iagree that the other side want to do something in Syria.'
p1203
aS'The question is, "Howimportant is this issue?'
p1204
aS"How much does it affect American interests, European interests,world interests, and is there some sensible way through in a world where things aremuch more complicated than they were in 1990 when we had the Kuwait conflict,where we have to deal in gray as much as in black and white, and where we riskparalysis if we don't try to do something rather than be paralyzed."
p1205
aS'So my suggestionwould be that the United States does indeed have a strategic interest in what happensin Syria.'
p1206
aS"I don't know that I can meet the very high bar that Graham and our othercolleague have mentioned in relation to an American intervention, whether this isimportant or not.And the proposers of this motion do want America to stand back."
p1207
aS"I would say that intoday's world you're dealing with complex changes within countries, you're dealing withsituations of extremism, instability, you're dealing with a humanitarian tragedy here inSyria, and you have to work out whether there's some recipe which has a reasonablechance of success."
p1208
aS'And the best need not be the enemy of the good in deciding that.'
p1209
aS"Idon't think, too, that we can wait for the perfect opposition party, some Jeffersoniandemocratic ideal to be formed in Syria."
p1210
aS"We don't have perfect opposition parties in ourown countries, let alone in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East."
p1211
aS"We've got to go withthe situation on the ground in the Middle East at the moment, where there is a hugeamount of uncertainty, and we have to decide whether we understand that dictatorslike Assad will at some point or other be swept away.And whether were prepared just to sit it out, and do very little to achieve a much betteroutcome."
p1212
aS'As Nick said earlier, the status quo really isnt sustainable for the UnitedStates, for Britain, and for our other allies, and thats where I really part company withGraham and with Richard.'
p1213
aS'If Assad stays in power, Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah are goingto win.'
p1214
aS'The vast majority of the Syrian population are going to be in revolt.'
p1215
aS'The longerthis goes on the conflict in Syria is going to spill over into the rest of the region.'
p1216
aS'The splitbetween the Sunni and the Shia within Islam is going to expand.'
p1217
aS"And speaking certainlyfor my country, we've seen a radicalization of our Muslim population because of Syria.It's become a recruiting sergeant for radicals around the world."
p1218
aS'And those young menand perhaps women are going to go to Syria and pick up a whole load of skills inviolence and in terrorism, which will be re-imported into our own countries andthreaten us very directly.'
p1219
aS"And I think that's a real risk for the U.K., for the U.S., and forothers.I spent nearly 36 years in the British diplomatic service."
p1220
aS'I believe in the transatlanticpartnership.'
p1221
aS"I think that there's little good that happens in the world if Europe andAmerica are not standing together."
p1222
aS'And I and my compatriots are friends of thiscountry.'
p1223
aS"But I do worry about America's credibility and standing if we just sit this oneout."
p1224
aS'President Obama talked last year about red lines and a game changer if Syria werefound to have used chemical weapons.'
p1225
aS'We now know that chemical weapons wereused by the Assad regime in the conflict.This administration, my government, many other governments have said unequivocallyover the months that Assad must go.'
p1226
aS'So what happens if he stays?'
p1227
aS'Is that without anyconsequence?'
p1228
aS'At the very least Iran is going to be watching and is going to draw aconclusion about American resolve and determination.'
p1229
aS'Russia and China will bewatching.'
p1230
aS"If this audience wants to sustain American leadership of a new kind after thedifficult decade that we've had, then I think we need an active, concerted,comprehensive policy in Syria, and not be defeated by the fear that anything we do willsuck us in militarily."
p1231
aS'And as Nick has said, that does not need to happen.'
p1232
aS"We've got aprogram which addresses the humanitarian problem, which accepts that this oppositionis not perfect, but there is a national coalition which has formed, which -- with whichthe U.S. government recognizes as the alternative government of Syria, which theEuropean governments and Arab League governments see in that role as well.And there are still moderate rebel forces in the form of the Free Syria -- channel armsthrough as a way of changing the situation on the ground, which is what we've got todo."
p1233
aS'Assad will not move by himself.'
p1234
aS'It will require persistent determined pressure overa range of areas, diplomatic, humanitarian, and then with these limited arms suppliesfrom the United States and indeed from other Arab countries.So to my mind that is a dog in the fight.'
p1235
aS"That's a strategic stake for the United Statesand for Britain and we've got to support this trend in the Arab world and we've got tosupport the Syrian people.John DonvanThank you, Nigel Sheinwald."
p1236
aS'Your time is up.'
p1237
aS"Ladies and gentleman, Nigel Sheinwald.And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the [[applause]] motion being debated is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.Remember, you voted before the debate and you will vote again once after the debate,after you've heard the arguments and the team who has won more percentage points ofyour support when the debate is over will be declared our winner.Now on to round two."
p1238
aS'Round two is where the debaters address each other directly andalso answer questions from you in the audience and from me.'
p1239
aS'We have two teams oftwo arguing out this motion, The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1240
aS'Graham Allisonand Richard Falkenrath are arguing in support of the motion, no dog in the fight.'
p1241
aS"Theyargue that Syria just does not represent a vital U.S. interest, that the U.S. has no optionsbefore it that can lead to a desirable solution or a solution that would actually improvethe problem, that there is no dog to pick in that fight, that the opposition fighting Assadis so fractured that it's difficult to know who should get the arms and a lot of them arepeople who would not end up being our friends."
p1242
aS'They say this is not one where the U.S.should be leading.Their opponents, Nick Burns and Nigel Sheinwald, say this is one where absolutely theU.S.'
p1243
aS'must lead.'
p1244
aS'The U.S. cannot sit this out, that it has a moral and pragmatic imperativeto get involved for humanitarian reasons, for political reasons.'
p1245
aS'They say that if Assadwins our allies in the region are really going to be in trouble, and they say there is apolitical process already in place that represents the dog that the U.S. can ride on this,and should ride all the way.'
p1246
aS'They are hopeful that it will ultimately produce results.'
p1247
aS'Iwant to put a question to the side thats arguing that the U.S. has no dog in the fight inSyria.'
p1248
aS'It looks as though what we have here basically to some degree is a disagreementabout definition of terms.'
p1249
aS'You have talked about not having a vital interest in gettinginvolved in Syria, and I want to put to you the question, just I think this allows us to goto some specifics, to look at some of whats actually happening there, and ask you to tellus why thats not vital.For example, as your opponents have pointed out, if Syria melts away as a state, even if-- with or without Assad, if it ends up being a chaotic place fueling and inviting aradicalization of a generation who would be our enemies, who would end up coming tothis country with weapons, doing bad things to us, how is that not a vital interest, andwhy isnt it?'
p1250
aS'Graham Allison.Graham AllisonA very good question.'
p1251
aS'I think the U.S. is a global power.'
p1252
aS"And I think -- if I go back toNigel's point just for a second -- the -- I think you set up a bit of a straw dog with the --with respect."
p1253
aS"The notion that there's anywhere we don't care about -- excuse me, wecare about things in 200 countries today."
p1254
aS'Things happening everywhere impact U.S.interests.'
p1255
aS"We don't sit with indifference for Sudan, for Somalia, for Pakistan, for Iraq, forany of the dozen wars that are going on now."
p1256
aS'But because the ability of U.S. -- both interms of mind share and also capabilities is limited -- about each case, your question,John, is right -- the very right question.If Syria melts down and comes to be three states or more chaotic than it is today, willthis be horrible?'
p1257
aS'Yes.'
p1258
aS'Will it have bigger impacts on U.S. interests?'
p1259
aS'Of course.'
p1260
aS"Does itrise to the level of vital -- if this --John DonvanWell, does it rise to --Graham Allison-- such that --John DonvanDoes it rise to the -- does it rise to the level of justifying intervention?Graham AllisonThat's right.John DonvanAnd you're saying it doesn't."
p1261
aS"Why not?Graham AllisonDoes it rise to a level of concern that would lead -- that would compel a responsiblegovernment to intervene militarily -- if that's the only way to resolve the issue?"
p1262
aS'And Iwould say the answer is no.'
p1263
aS'If Syria melts down, this will be horrible.'
p1264
aS'It will have impactson Lebanon, and on -- and on Iraq, of course.'
p1265
aS"It'll exacerbate the Sunni-Shi'ite division.Of course."
p1266
aS'All those things are also happening before Syria.John DonvanCould you --Graham AllisonIf Syria --John DonvanCould you take -- I want to go to the other side, first, Richard.'
p1267
aS"But I just want to askGraham -- just take 15 seconds -- what would represent a threat to America's vitalinterests?"
p1268
aS'Just to put the marker out there.Graham AllisonYeah.'
p1269
aS'If we look to the year ahead, Iran getting nuclear weapons.John DonvanOkay.'
p1270
aS"Let's go to the other side."
p1271
aS'Who would like to respond?'
p1272
aS'Nick Burns or NigelSheinwald?'
p1273
aS'Nick Burns.Nicholas BurnsWell, I just say this.'
p1274
aS'The question is -- who has a dog in the fight in Syria?'
p1275
aS'Do we haveone?'
p1276
aS"Do we care who wins and loses?John DonvanWell, Nigel, can you -- you've -- I'm sorry."
p1277
aS'Nick, you made that point in your opening.'
p1278
aS"Ijust want to see if you can respond to --Nicholas BurnsI'm responding to -- I'm responding right now.John DonvanYeah."
p1279
aS'All right.'
p1280
aS'Sounds very familiar.Nicholas BurnsGood.You try to repeat your major themes.'
p1281
aS'[[laughter]] John DonvanAll right.'
p1282
aS"Fair enough.I'm really not trying to clash with you, and I -- [[laughter]]  All right.Nicholas BurnsWe want you on our side, John.John DonvanOkay.Nicholas BurnsI was addressing Graham's point."
p1283
aS'And, you know, we are good friends and colleagues.And I think that Graham and Richard have raised some really important points.'
p1284
aS'This isnot an easy choice.'
p1285
aS"In fact, it's really difficult."
p1286
aS'And generally, in my career, John, thisanswers the question.'
p1287
aS"American presidents do not put American troops into harm's wayunless it's a vital interest.But that's not what President Obama's trying to do."
p1288
aS"He's not trying to put Americantroops into Syria."
p1289
aS"In fact, he said he won't."
p1290
aS"And Nigel and I are just arguing, because ofthe humanitarian interest, because of where Syria is, its proximity to Israel and othercountries, because of the imminent victory of Iran in a major power play, we need to beactive with President Obama's plan."
p1291
aS"But it doesn't have anything to do with vital."
p1292
aS'Andvital is not in that question.John DonvanAnd I think the key disagreement -- and both sides use this word -- was the word lead.And this side said this is not one where the U.S. needs to lead.'
p1293
aS"This side says the U.S.needs to lead and quoting you, Nigel Sheinwald, you can't sit this out."
p1294
aS'So, I want to takethat back to Richard Falkenrath.'
p1295
aS"This question of leadership.Richard FalkenrathThere's a lot of information that's coming out of Syria now, about what the peopleengaged are suffering from this fighting."
p1296
aS"Actually, I think -- and as far as they'reconcerned, we're sitting this one out."
p1297
aS"I mean, there's -- there is -- they're very clear, thereporting out of Syria is the U.S. is having no impact on the ground."
p1298
aS'In fact, the narrativelooks more like Al-Qaeda is having an impact and Hezbollah is having an impact.'
p1299
aS'But weare not.The -- it strikes me, as you kn0w, President Obama is stuck with no good options.'
p1300
aS'Andthis will go down in history as a failure of his policy.'
p1301
aS"But he's confronted only withoptions which make the failure even worse, because in order to really make an impacthere, we have to make a difference on the ground."
p1302
aS"It's not enough to figure out who towrite a check to or ship a bunch of light arms to."
p1303
aS"You have to figure out, who are wetipping the military balance in favor of so that there's a better outcome at the end."
p1304
aS"Andwe are not doing that at this time.John DonvanBut with your -- I don't want to say approval -- but you think that's the right choice atthis point?Richard FalkenrathYes.John DonvanOkay."
p1305
aS"Let's take it back to Nigel Sheinwald.Nigel SheinwaldWell, I --John DonvanYou're very good with the word yes."
p1306
aS"Nigel Sheinwald.Nigel Sheinwald [[laughter]] I just think that Richard's analysis is flawed and slanted in his favor, because the realityis that there is a political opposition in Syria."
p1307
aS"It's fragmented, but there is a central groupthat's all of us in the United States, in Europe, in the Arab League are supporting andrecognize an alternative government.And there is a group called the Free Syrian Army that can channel arms and it couldconceivably tip the balance quite quickly."
p1308
aS"Just this week we've seen examples of theattempted assassination of Assad."
p1309
aS"I'm not recommending that."
p1310
aS'But it happened.'
p1311
aS"Andwe've seen continued taking of territory by the moderate and recognized groups."
p1312
aS'Iaccept that there is Al-Qaeda involved.'
p1313
aS'There are a whole bunch of other groupsinvolved.'
p1314
aS"But that's been the situation throughout the Middle East over the past coupleof years."
p1315
aS"And in all those other areas, we haven't said that the Tunisian president muststay."
p1316
aS"We haven't said that Gadhafi must stay."
p1317
aS"We haven't said that Mubarak must stay.We couldn't say that and accept that the will of those people is just going to becompletely ignored."
p1318
aS"And that's what worries me about our opponents' position, thatthey are really arguing an old-fashioned view of realpolitik."
p1319
aS"Keeping someone in powerbecause it's the easiest option.John DonvanAll right."
p1320
aS'Let me -- Nigel, let me just interrupt you to give Graham a chance to respond tosome of your earlier points.'
p1321
aS'So, Graham Allison.Graham AllisonYeah.'
p1322
aS"I think your -- Nigel, what you're saying is persuasive."
p1323
aS'But -- okay.'
p1324
aS'The Free SyrianArmy representatives and the opposition -- as Rich said -- a lot of Americans know them.These are guys that we meet in Turkey.'
p1325
aS"You don't see them fighting on the ground inSyria."
p1326
aS"So, they're spending their time talking to folks like us, not having any control over1,200 different groups who are fighting independently."
p1327
aS"Chairman Dempsey said lastweek -- in that -- or two weeks ago -- in very important testimony he says here, just aquote About six months ago, we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition.Now I want to say it's even more opaque.John Donvan [[laughter]] Okay."
p1328
aS"Nick Burns?Nicholas BurnsJust to point a fact -- the Free Syrian Army is inside Syria.It's commended by General Salim Idris, our colleague David Ignatius of The WashingtonPost has reported on his activities there."
p1329
aS"It's the National Coalition, the political groupthat, you know, goes around the world, raising money, trying to raise consciousness."
p1330
aS"Iwould just say another thing about General Dempsey's testimony."
p1331
aS'All true.'
p1332
aS'This is goingto be -- if the United States were to get involved, it would be difficult.'
p1333
aS"But PresidentObama, his boss, is saying, We're not going to put troops on the ground."
p1334
aS"So I think thereal question here that I wanted to address to Rich and to Graham -- and this is hard -- isit's certainly legitimate of you to say there's a risk in what you're proposing, a risk inaction."
p1335
aS'But I think also the onus has to be on you to answer the question -- what is therisk of inaction?'
p1336
aS'If we do nothing, do we suffer?'
p1337
aS'Do American strategic interests suffer?John DonvanAnd I heard a little clap over there.'
p1338
aS"That's fine, to do that."
p1339
aS"So -- and again, as I saidearlier, because we're a radio broadcast, it tells the radio audience that ultimately willhear this that you're all here."
p1340
aS"So ---- you don't have to overdo it, but it's not like a presidential debate, where you're not [[laughter]] allowed and you have to sit on your hands."
p1341
aS"So -- just so, that's fine.But it's a great question."
p1342
aS"And I think it's one we all want to actually hear this sideanswer."
p1343
aS'What is the -- what are the consequences of inaction?'
p1344
aS"Now, you've said alreadyyou don't think they're vital."
p1345
aS'But what are they?'
p1346
aS"Richard Falkenrath.Richard FalkenrathWell, first, it's not as though we're inactive."
p1347
aS"We're doing something."
p1348
aS"It's just not makingany difference."
p1349
aS"And there's two halves ---- and this has been the case for a long time."
p1350
aS'I mean, this has been -- how long ago was it [[applause]] that President Obama said he needs to go?'
p1351
aS'Assad needs to go?'
p1352
aS"But there's two halves ofthe argument."
p1353
aS'The first is about vital national interests.'
p1354
aS"And I think -- it seems to us thatyou agree with us, that it -- we haven't met that bar."
p1355
aS"But there's a second half, which is,you need to reasonably articulate a plan that gets you to a better place when you'redone.And if you're unable to do that, then you are, by default, stuck with the badconsequences of inaction or of a policy that really isn't making much difference.And so, it -- in fact, the onus is on you to articulate an alternative plan that gets ussomewhere -- when ---- the interestingly -- you know, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just testified to [[applause]] this effect for his confirmation hearing."
p1356
aS"And he basically said there isn't one."
p1357
aS'And he was-- he went through six different options.'
p1358
aS'And he said, all of them -- none of them work.John DonvanNigel Sheinwald.Nigel SheinwaldAll of them are problematic.'
p1359
aS'But of course, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs supports thelimited supply of arms to the Syrian rebels that the president has authorized.'
p1360
aS'So, hebelieves that that is a reasonable policy choice, which will not drag America in in theway that the other policy options he analyzed might.'
p1361
aS"Now, I think the issue is, is this anydifferent from the other situations we've seen in the Middle East?"
p1362
aS'All very difficult.'
p1363
aS'Andin Tunisia, you saw a messy political protests leading to an election and the election of amoderate Islamist group.In Libya, everyone rightly said, was chaos.'
p1364
aS'But there was a transition process.'
p1365
aS'Therewere elections, again, with a moderate Islamist group elected.'
p1366
aS"It's still very chaotic inLibya, but we're all going to have to live with 10 or 20 years of unwinding of thisextraordinary set of events in the Middle East."
p1367
aS"We can't wait for that perfect moment toarrive.John DonvanI want to put a question back to this side."
p1368
aS'It\'s saying that this -- U.S. has no dog in thefight in Syria, the question was put to you, "What will be the consequences of inaction?'
p1369
aS'"You parried with a question back to the other side.'
p1370
aS'I allowed it to go.'
p1371
aS'But I really want toknow what your answer to the question is, the consequences of inaction.'
p1372
aS"Let's take aspecific your opponents put to you, not rescuing this humanitarian crisis."
p1373
aS'NigelSheinwald in his opening statement said, "This is just going to look real bad.'
p1374
aS'" We talked,I mentioned earlier, Rwanda, great regret about that.'
p1375
aS"Is it not significantly harmful toAmerican interests and reputation not to be acting in the case of the Syrian refugeesand the killing that's going on there?Graham AllisonAnd the answer is, of course it is.John DonvanGraham Allison.Graham AllisonAnd of course the U.S. is acting."
p1376
aS"I mean, let's be clear.Who is the largest supporter of humanitarian assistance to Syria today?"
p1377
aS'The U.S.President Obama announced last week another $195 million.'
p1378
aS'We have a billion dollars,and we should be doing much more, and we should be raising much more from otherparties.John DonvanBut, Graham, the --Graham Allison that --John Donvan-- I think the sense of the question is not strictly about blankets and tents.'
p1379
aS"I think part ofthe question is bringing back, say, for example, the example of Bosnia where a refugeecrisis -- in addition to other things -- but a refugee crisis prompted very, very aggressiveAmerican action not just in the --Graham AllisonI think that's a good analogy, and I think in that instance there were very specialcircumstances."
p1380
aS'Nick has actually written about this.'
p1381
aS'And he and I agree on this.'
p1382
aS'Therewere very special circumstances in which a limited U.S. military intervention made thedifference at the margin to get to a better place.'
p1383
aS'And I think that was a good example.'
p1384
aS'Inthis instance, why is it different?We have an old professor that used to make a list where you draw it down the middle ofthe page, you say, "Similar," and "Different.'
p1385
aS'" The similarities in this case are superficial.The differences are profound.John DonvanNick Burns.Nicholas Burns [[applause]] I guess what I\'m thinking is that, you know, I think President Obama is faced with a verydifficult choice.'
p1386
aS'Part of the problem is that Assad is trying to frame the internationaldebate, "It\'s me against the jihadists.'
p1387
aS"You Americans don't have a dog in the fight."
p1388
aS'"Actually, if you listen to the Iranians and listen to Russia, that\'s exactly what they\'resaying, "Stay out, you don\'t have an interest.'
p1389
aS'" What we\'re saying is, "We\'re facing acomplex environment there.'
p1390
aS'There are al-Qaeda groups, and there are jihadi groups.'
p1391
aS'"And Richard knows more about this than anybody, he\'s right about that, but there alsois the moderate element.'
p1392
aS'The only way to help the refugees and people of Syria is tosupport that moderate element.'
p1393
aS'Why should we want to see the jihadis and the Syriangovernment to be the only people armed?We have to give these moderate rebels a chance.'
p1394
aS"That's the basis of President Obama'spolicy, which we support.John Donvan [[applause]] Richard Falkenrath."
p1395
aS'Richard, can you hold for just one second?'
p1396
aS"After Richard speaks, I'dlike to go to the audience to begin getting questions from you."
p1397
aS'What will happen is thehouse lights will come up.'
p1398
aS"If you raise your hand I'll call on you."
p1399
aS'A mic will be brought toyou if you could stand up.'
p1400
aS"You'll be recorded and filmed, so if you could just state yourname and ask a question that's terse, that doesn't take more than 30 seconds or so, thatreally keeps on point, that gets these teams to debate on this matter."

p1430
aS"John Donvan No, you don't get to ask questions that far away."
p1431
aS'You can go sit in the audience.'
p1432
aS'Richard Falkenrath, your response.'
p1433
aS'Richard Falkenrath This -- Nick said a key term there, and I think their entire argument hangs on a very slender thread around the key term of "moderate opposition.'
p1434
aS'" And so we do, in fact, have a national coalition that was in December, not that long ago, recognized by the, quote, "friends of Syria," as the place to send the money.'
p1435
aS'But it is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, and it is essentially a playground for Qatari, Saudi, and UAE -- and Turkish influence peddling, that is internally divided, that has achieved notional external legitimacy, since someone has to get the money, but has no internal legitimacy.'
p1436
aS'The Free Syrian Army, our best hope for the moderate people on the ground fighting, is not integrated in any way.'
p1437
aS"It's a loose umbrella of dozens of different fighting groups."
p1438
aS"And let's just be clear, our friends in the Free Syrian Army, they were the ones who criticized us for deeming the Al-Nusra Front a terrorist organization because they coordinate their operations occasionally and the Al-Nusra Front bailed them out of a situation where they were about to get annihilated by the Syrian Army."
p1439
aS'So these are our friends?'
p1440
aS'This is the moderate opposition and the dog that you think we have?'
p1441
aS"I mean, this -- we don't get to pick the dominant post-Assad faction in Syria."
p1442
aS'John Donvan Response from this side before the questions?'
p1443
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1444
aS'Nigel Sheinwald My question back is do you think that, that representation of the opposition mirrors the Syrian people.'
p1445
aS"Let's go back to the Syrian people."
p1446
aS"Let's think what caused them to go into the streets and to rebel and to risk their lives two and a half years ago."
p1447
aS'And I think the Syrian people are basically moderates.'
p1448
aS'There is a strong tradition of inclusiveness, indeed of a secular tradition in Syria.'
p1449
aS"We have to get to the point where those people are given the chance to express their point of view, and I don't think I have enough confidence in the way that people operate to feel that if they're given a choice they won't vote for extreme voices."
p1450
aS"I think you've over-caricatured the fragmentation and extremism of the opposition."
p1451
aS"I agree it would've been much better if we'd taken much firmer, concerted, and comprehensive action two and a half years ago when the -- -- extremists and Islamist elements were much smaller than they are today, but I'm afraid the logic of what you're saying is give it another couple of years and it'll be much, much worse."
p1452
aS'John Donvan All right.'
p1453
aS"Let's go to questions, please."
p1454
aS'Sir, right on the aisle and, again, if you can stand up and tell us your name.'
p1455
aS'Mateo Grodofola Hi.'
p1456
aS'My name is Mateo Grodofola .'
p1457
aS'I have a question predominantly for the side which is saying that we should, in fact, intervene in Syria.'
p1458
aS'Given the way that large opposition groups like the Free Syrian Army have brutalized and attacked a variety of minority groups, such as the Kurds, the Alawite, the Christians, in Syria, can they necessarily be deemed to have a moral high ground ?'
p1459
aS'Are they the good guys?'
p1460
aS'John Donvan Have they disqualified themselves from our support?'
p1461
aS'Nick Burns, would you like to take that question?'
p1462
aS'Thanks for the question.'
p1463
aS'Nicholas Burns What we are proposing, and what President Obama is doing, is not proposing a military intervention in Syria.'
p1464
aS"We're proposing an intensified effort by the United States to rally international support for those moderate elements."
p1465
aS'Are they perfect?'
p1466
aS'No.'
p1467
aS'But compare them to the other side, to the outside government using artillery against civilian neighborhoods in Damascus and Aleppo and other Syrian cities, razing Homs and Hama.'
p1468
aS'Bashar al-Assad did that as his father did in 1982.'
p1469
aS"So, there's a big difference between the Syrian government and the moderate rebel forces, and in that relative light they are the good guys."
p1470
aS"John Donvan But do we need to be concerned about, as the questioner asked, the nasty stuff they've done?"
p1471
aS'I mean, deeply concerned?'
p1472
aS'Nicholas Burns Sure we do, and as I said before, neither of these sides are pure, but there is a difference.'
p1473
aS"And, you know, I think that what all of us are struggling with is that, you know, there is a risk of doing things and there are a lot of risks involved in what we're proposing, what the president's doing."
p1474
aS'We just think if we do nothing the status quo continues.'
p1475
aS"The real victims of that will be those 6.8 million Syrians who've lost their home or lost their job or can't live in the way they want to live."
p1476
aS"And so they're the people we've got to keep focused on."
p1477
aS"John Donvan On each of these questions I'll give the other side a chance to jump in if you want to or we'll go back to questions."
p1478
aS'Graham Allison.'
p1479
aS"Graham Allison Very briefly, I think the question was right on target, and I think to Nick -- we're not doing nothing."
p1480
aS"Nobody's proposing doing nothing."
p1481
aS"As I said before, we're the largest humanitarian assistance being provided."
p1482
aS"We're trying to work with the neighbors."
p1483
aS'The U.S. military is currently in Jordan and Turkey trying to prevent the spread of the violence.'
p1484
aS"We're currently trying to work with an international coalition to get negotiations going."
p1485
aS"We've been trying to get a peace negotiation in which the Russians would be co-hosting some negotiated outcome, which is our best hope."
p1486
aS"All those things we're doing, not successfully I would say, so the question is if it continues in this way with the killing and all the other things that we find as negative impacts for us, if it's so important to us, that if the only way to secure our interests is military intervention, we should do so."
p1487
aS'And we think the answer is, unfortunately, no.'
p1488
aS'John Donvan I do want to put the question to this side is there a level that this thing would reach where you would justify -- where you would support military intervention?'
p1489
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1490
aS"Nigel Sheinwald Well, I think that if you saw an extraordinary collapse in the situation in Syria, if you saw the chemical weapons getting into Hezbollah's hands or al-Qaeda's hands, then those exceptional circumstances would, I'm sure, cause the United States and cause its allies to think again."
p1491
aS"I don't think there'd actually be any difference between us on that."
p1492
aS"I think we're looking more at the situation today, whether it can be allowed to continue and ours is a very, very strong advice is that it can't."
p1493
aS'John Donvan Okay.'
p1494
aS'Another question.'
p1495
aS'Sir, right down in front here.'
p1496
aS"People who are farther back, I have a bias towards the front of the room because I don't see that well."

p1502
aS"How can it be in Israel's interests when the Assad regime collapses, the Sunni majority will become jihadists, how can that be in Israel's interests?"

p1610
aS"And you're right."
p1611
aS'The curious, ironic thing was that the Assads kept the peace with Israel and -- on the Golan, between 1967 and two years ago.'
p1612
aS'But the problem the Israelis have now, strategically, is that that Assad regime is significantly weakened.'
p1613
aS'And it looks like -- you know, Assad had some tactical victories in the last couple of months.'
p1614
aS'He suffered two defeats in the last week.'
p1615
aS"He cannot control his country any longer, so the Israelis can't bank on that."
p1616

p1622

p1623
aS"And I was talking to one of the leaders in the Israeli National Security community, who's a good friend of mine, last week."
p1624
aS'And so, I asked him just your question.'
p1625
aS'Does Israel have a dog in this fight?'
p1626
aS'And he says, Absolutely not.'
p1627
aS"Let's be clear if there's this transfer of advanced arms by the Syrians to people who are fighting Israel, like Hezbollah, we are acting -- and we're acting now -- so, Israel has attacked half a dozen times, particular instances of transfer."

p1636

p1637

p1638
aS'You mentioned the peace talks which have been stalled.'
p1639
aS'And to what extent can increased intervention from the friends of Syria and the United States give both sticks and carrots to give Russia -- particularly -- an incentive to get Assad to the table and negotiate a transfer which might provide some opportunity for those moderate elements?'
p1640
aS'John Donvan Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1641
aS'Nigel Sheinwald Well, I think this -- particularly the United States -- have tried that with the Russians, over a long, long period, to get them to change their position sufficiently to get Assad seriously to the negotiating table.'
p1642
aS"And it hasn't worked so far."
p1643
aS"I'd have to say, in the present state of U.S.-Russian relations, doesn't look more likely to be more successful, you know, in the weeks and months ahead."
p1644
aS'I fear that the only thing that will get Assad to negotiate or allow his team to negotiate is a change in the situation on the ground.'
p1645
aS'And I think this is where we do differ, the two teams here.'
p1646
aS"We're saying there are things that can change that situation on the ground."
p1647
aS'And the rebels say themselves, they want more American and international support.'
p1648
aS'They want the arms from the United States.'
p1649
aS'They want the arms from Qatar and from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.'
p1650
aS'And they believe that with them, they can tip the balance, change the situation on the ground sufficiently to put Assad and his regime under pressure and start a negotiation.'
p1651
aS"And the opposition in Syria isn't saying that Assad -- the whole regime cannot be part of the negotiation."
p1652
aS"They're saying, we can't negotiate with Assad himself, but we're not going to do what happened in Iraq."
p1653
aS"We're not going to banish the whole of the regime, the whole army, the whole public service."
p1654
aS"We're going to negotiate with the people around Assad, form a transition, and then let the people decide."
p1655
aS'John Donvan All right.'
p1656
aS"Nigel Sheinwald And I think it's conceivable."
p1657
aS"John Donvan Richard Falkenrath, it's part of your argument is that the undogworthiness of this battle is the impossibility of any of these things coming to being -- or the near impossibility."
p1658
aS"What's your response to the scenario just laid out?"
p1659
aS'Richard Falkenrath I think -- first Nigel is correct that in order to get a negotiated settlement with Assad, you do need to change the situation on the ground.'
p1660
aS'You do need to change the balance of military power in one way.'
p1661
aS'In fact, it has changed in the last year in two ways -- Hezbollah entered in force from Lebanon.'
p1662
aS'And Al-Qaeda entered in force from Iraq.'
p1663
aS'Not us.'
p1664
aS'And so, I think the basic diplomatic premise is correct.'
p1665
aS'You need to shift the military balance in such a way that it is in their interests to achieve a negotiated settlement.'
p1666
aS"Now, that's -- the problem with that is that's what we call a proxy war."
p1667
aS'And so, it is a recipe for entering a proxy war in Syria, not just against Assad, but against Al-Qaeda.'
p1668
aS"And so, proxies are what we do when we want to change the military balance in a country but don't want to be there ourselves."
p1669
aS'And so, you are left with no alternative on your side of the debate if you do want to change the ground -- the situation on the ground but to engage in a proxy war in Syria which the military analysis -- which is not favorable to that case.'

p1680
aS"Therefore, it's in our strategic interests to push back."
p1681
aS'We choose not to push back with American troops on the ground.'
p1682
aS"But if we can push back by weakening Assad and by supporting the moderates and making it more likely than not that the moderates will succeed and be victorious eventually -- that's a defeat for Iran."
p1683
aS"So, a lot of what we're doing here is trying to counter and limit Iran's inroads into the heart of the Middle East."
p1684
aS'John Donvan Sir, in the far back, in the white t-shirt?'
p1685
aS'Steve Began Thank you.'
p1686
aS'My name is Steve Began .'
p1687
aS'And I have a question for both panels.'
p1688
aS"We're actually talking about a very complex issue that's playing out before us."
p1689
aS'I think the real test of each of your positions is going to be in the outcome.'
p1690
aS"And so, what I'd ask you to do is look forward to a potential outcome."
p1691
aS"If your position prevailed - - and we aren't talking about getting in -- intervening or not."
p1692
aS"We're talking about degrees of intervention, really, here, I think, between the two panels."
p1693
aS'If your degree of intervention -- if your position prevailed, what outcome, within realism, do you think would be most favorable for the United States interests?'
p1694
aS"John Donvan That's a terrific question."
p1695
aS"I'd like to put it first to the side that's arguing the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria."
p1696
aS"If you -- if -- what policy prescription are you actually suggesting and what's the outcome of that prescription, if you can predict?"
p1697
aS'Graham Allison.'
p1698
aS'Graham Allison Absolutely great question.'
p1699
aS"I would say that our hope would be -- and the best hope -- but it's a stretch -- but the best hope is a situation in which the combination of humanitarian assistance to the victims and close working with the neighbors in the region and a strategic concept of a government that could exist after a transition leads to a negotiation in which there's an extended transition of power."
p1700
aS"And I would say that's a stretch."
p1701
aS"That's a distant hope."
p1702
aS'But the alternatives to that -- if I looked at them -- are worse.'
p1703
aS'John Donvan On this side?'
p1704
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1705
aS"Nigel Sheinwald I don't think our recipe is fundamentally different."
p1706
aS"It's the same."
p1707
aS'I think our view is that that has to be approached more urgently.'
p1708
aS'And we need to put more tools on the table, get more involved short of being sucked into boots on the ground and real military action.'
p1709
aS'And the worry I have is that it gets much more difficult to see that political transition ending in a reasonable representative Syrian government the longer this goes on.'
p1710
aS"And the problem is that we've waited a long time."
p1711
aS'The extremists have the upper hand.'
p1712
aS"And what you're saying, I think, is that we just have to accept that Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah should slug it out."
p1713
aS'We say no.'
p1714
aS'There remains a distinct and credible moderate force within Syria that we have to support and get to the point where they can make their own decision.'
p1715
aS'Graham Allison one more -- John Donvan Yes.'
p1716
aS'Graham Allison.'
p1717
aS'Yes.'
p1718
aS'Graham Allison.'
p1719
aS'Graham Allison I -- I mean I think Nigel is speaking directly to the point.'
p1720
aS'But I would have to -- Fareed Zakaria who has been struggling with this a lot -- had a good line recently.'
p1721
aS'And I wonder if you disagree.'
p1722
aS"He says, quote, We want an outcome in Syria that's even more ambitious than the one we sought in Iraq."
p1723
aS'And yet, we imagine that we can get it by a no-fly zone or even less than that.'
p1724
aS'So, do you disagree with that?'
p1725
aS"Nigel Sheinwald I don't disagree fundamentally."
p1726
aS"But I'm just looking at the other comparable examples."
p1727
aS"And my comparable examples will be not ones very appealing to this audience or to a British audience in terms of what we'd want politically."
p1728
aS'But I look at Tunisia.'
p1729
aS'I look at Egypt.'
p1730
aS'I look at Libya.'
p1731
aS"I see all the reasons why it would have been very convenient to keep the old regimes in power, but I don't see Al-Qaeda in charge in any of those places."
p1732
aS"And I don't see why that needs to be the case in Syria either."
p1733
aS'John Donvan Well hear from Richard and then -- Richard Falkenrath.'
p1734
aS'Richard Falkenrath A lot hangs on your assessment of the character of the Syrian state.'
p1735
aS'And one of the key differences between Tunisia and Egypt, lesser extent Libya, is the sectarian division in Syria is far worse.'
p1736
aS'And so the speed with which the protest took off and the violence took off was not merely a moderate bourgeois rebellion against an autocrat.'
p1737
aS'It was the emergence of a sectarian conflict which has been suppressed by force by the Alawites, a Shiite sect, for years, at least going back to 1970, and where the only other active political entity, the Muslim Brotherhood, was destroyed viciously by Assad in Hama.'
p1738
aS"So, I mean, to say that -- to hang so much on the idea that a moderate Syrian secular leadership and consensus will emerge, as Graham says, that's -- we didn't even develop that in Iraq."
p1739
aS'John Donvan Nick Burns.'
p1740
aS"Nicholas Burns I think that -- -- I think that Graham asked a fair question, and Fareed's a smart guy."
p1741
aS"The difference between the U.S. intervening and Iraq in March 2003 and what we're talking about now is that the Syrian moderates have a lot more support, frankly, than the United States did going into Iraq."
p1742
aS"If you look at Turkey's support, and the support of all the Gulf countries, nearly every other Arab country, all of Europe, and the United States, and Canada, I think that's probably the best way for this loose international coalition to succeed eventually in helping the Syrian rebels to stay together and to draw on that international unity."
p1743
aS"And remember the question here is not whether we have a vital interest, not whether we're going to intervene militarily, we're not going to do that, do we care who wins, and do we put our shoulder behind that side, that's what President Obama's said he wants to do."
p1744
aS'And I find that logical.'
p1745
aS'John Donvan Right in the center.'
p1746
aS'Lindsay Hanahan Hi.'
p1747
aS"My name's Lindsay Hanahan , and I'm desperate for some hope here."
p1748
aS'So we have a new leader in Iran.'
p1749
aS"And I'm hearing this conversation about the proxy fight."
p1750
aS"Does the fact that we have a new leader in Iran give us some possibility he's come up and said that he is willing to reach out?"
p1751
aS'John Donvan Can you rephrase your question, and I know that you can, that relates it to what -- kind of what the American interest in being involved is?'
p1752
aS"Lindsay Hanahan If we're looking at do we or do we not have a dog in the fight, and part of that hinges on who that dog is that we're fighting as well, I believe, so I'm saying if who we're fighting changes in terms of this proxy, do we now have a dog in the fight if Iran pulls out and -- John Donvan And who's on the other side?"
p1753
aS"Lindsay Hanahan Who's on the other side -- John Donvan Right, okay."
p1754
aS'Lindsay Hanahan -- changes.'
p1755
aS'John Donvan Great, actually really well skillfully done, thank you.'
p1756
aS"Who'd like to take that side first?"
p1757
aS'Richard Falkenrath.'
p1758
aS"Richard Falkenrath I'm arguing the U.S. has no dog in the fight."
p1759
aS"I don't have a crystal ball but I doubt it."
p1760
aS'I doubt that the new elected president controls it.'
p1761
aS"It's a longstanding -- I mean, Syria is Iran's last friend in the region."
p1762
aS'Their support for Hezbollah goes back to 1982.'
p1763
aS"Syria's the funnel through which the arms get to Hezbollah."
p1764
aS'And the new president is not, in fact, the supreme leader.'
p1765
aS'The supreme leader is the supreme leader.'
p1766
aS'And so this policy seems pretty well marbled in the Iranian state, and I doubt it will change of its own accord just because of an election.'
p1767
aS'John Donvan The other side, Nick Burns?'
p1768
aS"Nicholas Burns I think it's a really good question."
p1769
aS"And I don't disagree with Richard."
p1770
aS"I think he's probably right."
p1771
aS'But there is a -- possibly an opportunity here.'
p1772
aS'Rouhani was inaugurated last Sunday.'
p1773
aS"He's a different guy than Jalili, the former nuclear negotiator."
p1774
aS'The Europeans found him to be more pragmatic and straightforward when they dealt with him a couple of years ago.'
p1775
aS"So we've been talking this week at Aspen."
p1776
aS'How should the U.S. approach him on this subject of Syria on the nuclear question?'
p1777
aS'We ought to give negotiations a chance.'
p1778
aS"We haven't had a serious negotiation with Iran and sustained since the Jimmy Carter administration."
p1779
aS'So we ought to open up a conversation.'
p1780
aS"We may not be able -- probably won't -- I think Richard's right -- change their minds, but let's put Syria on the table, and let's let the Iranians know that this is a big deal for us, and for Israel, and for Europe, and see if we can make some progress there."
p1781
aS"It's at least worth a try."
p1782
aS'John Donvan That was a great question.'
p1783
aS'Thank you.'
p1784
aS'And, sir, over here, and I think you might be our last question.'
p1785
aS'Jenna, do we have more time after this, or we need to -- Arly Sherman My name is Arly Sherman .'
p1786
aS"As I recall, since I think I'm older than most of this group, that Harry Truman said that it was not in our special interests to defend the Korean Peninsula or the Straits of Formosa."
p1787
aS'And it was a green light for the Russians, the Chinese, and everyone to move.'
p1788
aS'Are we not giving a green light now for Iran to move and are moving and doing the same thing that Harry Truman did?'
p1789
aS'John Donvan Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1790
aS"Nigel Sheinwald Well, that's our worry."
p1791
aS"I mean, that's one of our concerns over this continued stalemate."
p1792
aS"Letting Assad stay in power is de facto -- it's a victory for Iran."
p1793
aS"It extends further their influence because they have thousands of their own people now in Syria in a way that they weren't a short while ago."
p1794
aS"And I think that, although I too agree that there's going to be -- very unlikely to be an immediate change on the Rouhanis part, nevertheless, we want to create uncertainty in their minds."
p1795
aS'And the uncertainty that Assad may go and that something different may emerge in Syria.'
p1796
aS"I think it's a good thing in trying to get them to negotiate seriously with us on the other issues."
p1797
aS'John Donvan And Graham Allison.'
p1798
aS'Graham Allison Well, I would say in one word, no, okay?'
p1799
aS'The situations are entirely different.'
p1800
aS'There are numerous places in the world where the U.S. does have vital interests.'
p1801
aS'There usually we have an alliance.'
p1802
aS'For example, Israel we regard as an ally.'
p1803
aS"If there's an attack on an ally we think this reaches the level of a threat to our vital interest, and for those we are prepared to act."
p1804
aS"There are many, many other situations in the world in which we're not prepared to act."
p1805
aS"That doesn't mean that on some occasions we don't."
p1806
aS'North Korea is a good example.'
p1807
aS"But it seems to me that we went around everywhere saying to everyone if something bad happens in Somalia we're going to become involved militarily."
p1808
aS"If something happens in Sudan we're going to become involved militarily."
p1809
aS"If something happens in Pakistan, where there's an even bigger war right -- we're going to become militarily involved."
p1810
aS'We will soon find the U.S. everywhere.'
p1811
aS'John Donvan And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p1812
aS"And here's where we are."
p1813
aS'We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn.'
p1814
aS'Those closing statements will be two minutes each.'
p1815
aS'Remember how you voted just before the debate, immediately after these statements we will have you vote again.'
p1816
aS'So, this is their last chance to try to win over your votes.'
p1817
aS'Our motion is this: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1818
aS'Round three, closing statements, here to speak first against the motion, Nicholas, you do the -- seated for the closing statements -- to speak against the motion, Nicholas Burns.'
p1819
aS'He is professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and former undersecretary of state for political affairs.'
p1820
aS'Nicholas Burns Thank you.'
p1821
aS"And I've really enjoyed this debate."
p1822
aS'Thanks to Richard and Graham.'
p1823
aS"Eighteen years ago at the height of the Bosnian war in 1995, I found myself a State Department spokesperson and my job basically was to give daily press conferences and defend the Clinton administration's foreign policy."
p1824
aS'One of the toughest and most painful moments of my entire career came in July of that year when the Bosnian Serb military went through a Dutch U.N. garrison outside the city of Srebrenica.'
p1825
aS'They went into the town.'
p1826
aS'They rounded up -- well, they divided the men and the women.'
p1827
aS'They rounded up 8,000 men and boys and they shot them.'
p1828
aS'It was the worst massacre in the world since the Nazis massacred European Jewry.'
p1829
aS"And I had to explain the following days, as did my White House colleague, Mike McCurry, why didn't the United States act?"
p1830
aS"Why weren't we involved?"
p1831
aS"Why hadn't we made sure that the United Nations had a tougher mission in Bosnia?"
p1832
aS'And a lot of us in the Clinton administration at that time vowed that we would never again stand by with all the power of the United States and our leadership and let something like that happen.'
p1833
aS"Now we can't be everywhere."
p1834
aS"Graham's right."
p1835
aS"We can't solve the world's problems."
p1836
aS"We're not the world's policemen."
p1837
aS"We can't intervene everywhere."
p1838
aS'But at least we can try without putting military forces in, to help the people of Syria.'
p1839
aS'The people who are supporting the rebel groups are the majority in Syria.'
p1840
aS'They deserve a chance.'
p1841
aS'And the approach that Nigel and I outlined is far better than doing nothing, because if we say we have no dog in the fight, we consign the Syrian people to the brutalization of the Assad government.'
p1842
aS'We do have a dog in the fight.'
p1843
aS"It's to lead by moral example, to do what we can to help those people survive."
p1844
aS"And it may be two, three, or four years before they're able to get on their feet, form a new government and kick Assad out, but we need to stay the course with them."
p1845
aS'Thank you very much.'
p1846
aS'John Donvan Thank you.'
p1847
aS'Nicholas Burns.'
p1848
aS'Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria and here to speak in support of the motion, it means he thinks the U.S. has no dog in this fight, Richard Falkenrath, a principle with the Chertoff Group and former deputy homeland security advisor.'
p1849
aS"Richard Falkenrath So, if we interpret this motion as do we care, there's no difference between the two panels."
p1850
aS'We do.'
p1851
aS'I think Graham, I, Nick, Nigel, we equally abhor this violence, and if we could stop this butchery we can, we would.'
p1852
aS'But the proposition before us is what to do about it.'
p1853
aS"And here, I think you've heard slightly different prescriptions from Nick and Nigel and I'm going to choose to focus on the one I heard from Nigel, which I think is correct, that a political outcome in Syria requires changing facts on the ground."
p1854
aS'In order to change the facts on the ground you need to tilt the military balance against Assad in some way or another.'
p1855
aS'That is what we call a proxy war.'
p1856
aS'I have no objection -- on a principle basis -- to proxy warfare.'
p1857
aS'But I do, on a pragmatic basis, which is if we are going to get into them, we should have a reasonable belief that we can succeed.'
p1858
aS'And that, unfortunately, is not the case here.'
p1859
aS"And it's not the case for several different reasons, one of which is our proxy is not very reliable, and in fact, not very powerful, this moderate opposition."
p1860
aS'Another is the opponent is deeply entrenched and their own sponsors -- Hezbollah, Iran, Russia -- are completely uninhibited by the strength that we have.'
p1861
aS'Russia is sending advanced anti-aircraft systems to Syria right now.'
p1862
aS'There -- and apparently lawful under international law.'
p1863
aS"And we can't even -- we struggle over whether to send light arms."
p1864
aS"So I think the other side, though they wish to avoid saying we're for military intervention -- in fact, the essence of their political strategy requires a change of the military facts on the ground."
p1865
aS'And that involves giving military support to the fighters.'
p1866
aS'That is that we call a proxy war.'
p1867
aS'And unless you are very, very sure that you will prevail in the end, it strikes me as an unwise policy.'
p1868
aS'And if you interpret the motion that way, I think you need to say -- invoke with -- where Graham and I stand.'
p1869
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Richard Falkenrath.'
p1870
aS'And our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1871
aS'And here to speak against this motion -- it means he does think the U.S. has a dog in the fight in Syria -- Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1872
aS"He's a former British ambassador to the U.S. and foreign policy and defense adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair."
p1873
aS'Nigel Sheinwald Ladies and gentlemen, well, thank you very much for listening this evening.'
p1874
aS"I'm not a gung-ho interventionist."
p1875
aS"I've spent my life being as a pragmatist and a realist about these things."
p1876
aS'And as you mentioned at the beginning, John, six years ago, my prime minister, Tony Blair, sent me to Damascus to try to negotiate with President Assad for a better, less confrontational relationship between Syria and our countries.'
p1877
aS'And we made a bit of progress.'
p1878
aS'We had a long day of negotiation.'
p1879
aS"We made a bit of progress in relation to Syria's relationship with Iraq."
p1880
aS'But on the big issues -- on Iran, on Lebanon, on his overall relationship with us, I came away empty-handed.'
p1881
aS'And I concluded two things from that.'
p1882
aS'The first thing was, the importance -- the really crucial importance of Syria in its region and internationally.'
p1883
aS"Things won't get done in this region -- and America has many interests -- Iran, Israel, much else in the Middle East -- without Syria being much more stable, having much better future than it has today."
p1884
aS"And secondly, I concluded Assad wouldn't make good choices by himself."
p1885
aS'Unfortunately, things have collapsed significantly since then, because he reacted as badly and unwisely as he did to the revolution which started in March of 2011.'
p1886
aS"He could have handled it differently, but he chose to terrorize his people, 100,000 people said, as we've all said."
p1887
aS'So, I agree with what Rich said earlier.'
p1888
aS"I don't think there's a difference between us in the sense of do we care."
p1889
aS'Yes, I think we do.'
p1890
aS"It's a question about how much and what our tolerance is for allowing the present situation to continue, and about whether we really have reacted to the different world in the Middle East today and elsewhere, where we can't find perfect situations and where we need to intervene in the best way we can."
p1891
aS'And we think there is a realistic prospect of getting to a position where the Syrians themselves can decide.'
p1892
aS"And that's what we got to back."
p1893
aS"And that's our dog in the fight."
p1894
aS'John Donvan Thank you.'
p1895
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.'
p1896
aS'Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p1897
aS'And here to speak in support of the motion who says the U.S. does not have a dog in this fight Graham Allison.'
p1898
aS"He is director of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former assistant secretary of defense."
p1899
aS'Graham Allison Thank you.'
p1900
aS'My old professor, Henry Kissinger, has a cushion in his home office that says, Try to be the person your dog thinks you are.'
p1901
aS'Okay?'
p1902
aS"So, if you find your dog in the fight, you're obliged to do everything you physically can -- including risks to your own life and limb -- to rescue your dog."
p1903
aS'Okay?'
p1904
aS'I had that experience only once.'
p1905
aS'I almost killed a German Shepherd that had its jaws around the throat of our little Corgi, Annie.'
p1906
aS'And I hope I never have such an experience again.'
p1907
aS"So, that's to have a dog in the fight."
p1908
aS'As you think about your vote tonight, I would say, ask three questions -- I would urge you to consider three questions.'
p1909
aS"First, we are just exiting two wars in which we entered without understanding the realities of the country to which we sent Americans to fight -- So, who imagines that we understand what's happening in Syria better than we did in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
p1910
aS'Second question -- this has come up in the debates that we had the Aspen Strategy Group this week.'
p1911
aS"There're almost parallel realities."
p1912
aS'On the one hand, foreign policy experts look abroad and say, Here dragons: this is a problem, this is a danger.'
p1913
aS'We need to mount an effort.'
p1914
aS"But there's another reality, which is where is this country today?"
p1915
aS'Look at Washington -- not just broke, but broken.'
p1916
aS'Stalemated.'
p1917
aS'Unable to even have a budget.'
p1918
aS'And maybe on a drift to a closedown of the government.'
p1919
aS"Is this a government that's ready to engage in yet another military operation?"
p1920
aS'Finally, I would say -- it -- for those of you -- -- for those of you that have children or grandchildren, if you imagine that by voting that we have a dog in the fight, you were at risk of sending your daughter or son to Syria, how would you vote?'
p1921
aS'John Donvan Graham Allison, thank you very much.'
p1922
aS'Your time.'
p1923
aS'And that concludes our closing statements.'
p1924
aS'And now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best.'
p1925
aS"We're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat."
p1926
aS"Once again, it's the 1-2-3 vote."
p1927
aS'If you were persuaded by the side that is arguing that the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria, push number 1.'
p1928
aS"It's this side."
p1929
aS'If you were persuaded by their opponents, who are arguing that yes, the U.S. does have a dog in the fight in Syria -- that is this side -- push number 2.'
p1930
aS'And if you are undecided, became undecided, or remain undecided, push number 3.'
p1931
aS"And we'll have the results and the announcement of the winner -- according to our rules -- in just about two minutes."
p1932
aS'And once again, we determine victory by the number of percentage points that has moved from one side to the other.'
p1933
aS'All right.'
p1934
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to take care of a couple of pleasant pieces of business.'
p1935
aS'And the main one is to say that the spirit and the honesty and the respect for one another that these debaters brought to the stage is what Intelligence Squared aims for.'
p1936
aS'The level of argument was superb and I want to thank them for that.'
p1937
aS'I also want to say that very often, the questions are a problematic area in these debates.'
p1938
aS'They were superb tonight.'
p1939
aS'Every single question was on point.'
p1940
aS"Or if it wasn't, it was quickly refashioned."
p1941
aS'And it really moved this debate in a better direction.'
p1942
aS'So, I want to thank everybody who had the nerve to get up and ask a question.'
p1943
aS"I also want to thank, for being here with us, some guests that we're delighted to have."
p1944
aS'The former Secretary of State, Secretary Albright.'
p1945
aS'Thank you very much for being here.'
p1946

S'I think --John DonvanNick Burns.Nicholas BurnsI think that American and Israeli interests are identical.'
p2039
aS'And they have been for a longtime on the Golan Heights.'
p2040
aS"And you're right.The curious, ironic thing was that the Assads kept the peace with Israel and -- on theGolan, between 1967 and two years ago."
p2041
aS'But the problem the Israelis have now,strategically, is that that Assad regime is significantly weakened.'
p2042
aS'And it looks like -- youknow, Assad had some tactical victories in the last couple of months.'
p2043
aS'He suffered twodefeats in the last week.'
p2044
aS"He cannot control his country any longer, so the Israelis can'tbank on that."
p2045
aS'What we have to hope is that moderate elements in the Syrian oppositionwill emerge victorious, the kind of people who will understand they have to keep thepeace with Israel as well in the future.'
p2046
aS"That's the basis, I think, of what President Obamais trying to do.John DonvanRichard, do you want to take that?"
p2047
aS"Only -- I'm only asking you because we haven't heardfrom you in a bit."
p2048
aS"Or you can seek your partner.Graham Allison -John DonvanGraham Allison.Graham AllisonThis is a -- it's a great question."
p2049
aS"And I was talking to one of the leaders in the IsraeliNational Security community, who's a good friend of mine, last week."
p2050
aS'And so, I askedhim just your question.'
p2051
aS'Does Israel have a dog in this fight?'
p2052
aS"And he says, Absolutelynot.Let's be clear if there's this transfer of advanced arms by the Syrians to people who arefighting Israel, like Hezbollah, we are acting -- and we're acting now -- so, Israel hasattacked half a dozen times, particular instances of transfer."
p2053
aS'But he said, our officialposition and our operational position is we will not intervene in the civil war.'
p2054
aS"That's thequote.John DonvanAnother question?"
p2055
aS"Ma'am?Emma RubsaxI feel this has moved very quickly --John DonvanWill you just tell your name -- us your name, please?"
p2056
aS'Sorry.Emma RubysaxOh, yeah.'
p2057
aS'Emma Rubysax .'
p2058
aS'I feel that this has moved very quicklyfrom dog to feasibility.'
p2059
aS'So my question is about feasibility.'
p2060
aS'You mentioned the peacetalks which have been stalled.'
p2061
aS'And to what extent can increased intervention from thefriends of Syria and the United States give both sticks and carrots to give Russia --particularly -- an incentive to get Assad to the table and negotiate a transfer whichmight provide some opportunity for those moderate elements?John DonvanNigel Sheinwald.Nigel SheinwaldWell, I think this -- particularly the United States -- have tried that with the Russians,over a long, long period, to get them to change their position sufficiently to get Assadseriously to the negotiating table.'
p2062
aS"And it hasn't worked so far."
p2063
aS"I'd have to say, in thepresent state of U.S.-Russian relations, doesn't look more likely to be more successful,you know, in the weeks and months ahead."
p2064
aS'I fear that the only thing that will get Assadto negotiate or allow his team to negotiate is a change in the situation on the ground.And I think this is where we do differ, the two teams here.'
p2065
aS"We're saying there are thingsthat can change that situation on the ground."
p2066
aS'And the rebels say themselves, they wantmore American and international support.'
p2067
aS'They want the arms from the United States.They want the arms from Qatar and from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.'
p2068
aS'And they believethat with them, they can tip the balance, change the situation on the ground sufficientlyto put Assad and his regime under pressure and start a negotiation.'
p2069
aS"And the oppositionin Syria isn't saying that Assad -- the whole regime cannot be part of the negotiation.They're saying, we can't negotiate with Assad himself, but we're not going to do whathappened in Iraq."
p2070
aS"We're not going to banish the whole of the regime, the whole army,the whole public service."
p2071
aS"We're going to negotiate with the people around Assad, form atransition, and then let the people decide.John DonvanAll right.Nigel SheinwaldAnd I think it's conceivable.John DonvanRichard Falkenrath, it's part of your argument is that the undogworthiness of this battleis the impossibility of any of these things coming to being -- or the near impossibility.What's your response to the scenario just laid out?Richard FalkenrathI think -- first Nigel is correct that in order to get a negotiated settlement with Assad,you do need to change the situation on the ground."
p2072
aS'You do need to change the balanceof military power in one way.'
p2073
aS'In fact, it has changed in the last year in two ways --Hezbollah entered in force from Lebanon.'
p2074
aS'And Al-Qaeda entered in force from Iraq.'
p2075
aS'Notus.'
p2076
aS'And so, I think the basic diplomatic premise is correct.'
p2077
aS"You need to shift the militarybalance in such a way that it is in their interests to achieve a negotiated settlement.Now, that's -- the problem with that is that's what we call a proxy war."
p2078
aS"And so, it is arecipe for entering a proxy war in Syria, not just against Assad, but against Al-Qaeda.And so, proxies are what we do when we want to change the military balance in acountry but don't want to be there ourselves."
p2079
aS"And so, you are left with no alternative onyour side of the debate if you do want to change the ground -- the situation on theground but to engage in a proxy war in Syria which the military analysis -- which is notfavorable to that case.John DonvanI want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this IntelligenceSquared U.S. debate.I'm John Donvan, your moderator."
p2080
aS'We have four debaters -- two teams of two -- [[applause]] debating this motion: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p2081
aS"I can go to anotherquestion, but Nick Barnes, I don't know if you wanted to respond to Richard."
p2082
aS"I thoughtthat I saw that you -- you -- you're --You're good?Nicholas BurnsNo."
p2083
aS'I think Richard --John DonvanGo ahead.'
p2084
aS'Nick Burns.Nicholas Burns-- has addressed the central question -- does it concern the United States that Iran isrising to power in the Middle East?A victory by Assad is a victory for the mullahs in Tehran.'
p2085
aS"Therefore, it's in our strategicinterests to push back."
p2086
aS'We choose not to push back with American troops on theground.'
p2087
aS"But if we can push back by weakening Assad and by supporting the moderatesand making it more likely than not that the moderates will succeed and be victoriouseventually -- that's a defeat for Iran."
p2088
aS"So, a lot of what we're doing here is trying tocounter and limit Iran's inroads into the heart of the Middle East.John DonvanSir, in the far back, in the white t-shirt?Steve BeganThank you."
p2089
aS'My name is Steve Began .'
p2090
aS'And I have a question forboth panels.'
p2091
aS"We're actually talking about a very complex issue that's playing out beforeus."
p2092
aS'I think the real test of each of your positions is going to be in the outcome.'
p2093
aS"And so,what I'd ask you to do is look forward to a potential outcome."
p2094
aS"If your position prevailed -- and we aren't talking about getting in -- intervening or not."
p2095
aS"We're talking aboutdegrees of intervention, really, here, I think, between the two panels."
p2096
aS"If your degree ofintervention -- if your position prevailed, what outcome, within realism, do you thinkwould be most favorable for the United States interests?John DonvanThat's a terrific question."
p2097
aS"I'd like to put it first to the side that's arguing the U.S. has nodog in the fight in Syria."
p2098
aS"If you -- if -- what policy prescription are you actually suggestingand what's the outcome of that prescription, if you can predict?"
p2099
aS'Graham Allison.Graham AllisonAbsolutely great question.'
p2100
aS"I would say that our hope would be -- and the best hope --but it's a stretch -- but the best hope is a situation in which the combination ofhumanitarian assistance to the victims and close working with the neighbors in theregion and a strategic concept of a government that could exist after a transition leadsto a negotiation in which there's an extended transition of power."
p2101
aS"And I would say that'sa stretch."
p2102
aS"That's a distant hope."
p2103
aS'But the alternatives to that -- if I looked at them -- areworse.John DonvanOn this side?'
p2104
aS"Nigel Sheinwald.Nigel SheinwaldI don't think our recipe is fundamentally different."
p2105
aS"It's the same."
p2106
aS'I think our view is thatthat has to be approached more urgently.'
p2107
aS'And we need to put more tools on the table,get more involved short of being sucked into boots on the ground and real militaryaction.'
p2108
aS'And the worry I have is that it gets much more difficult to see that politicaltransition ending in a reasonable representative Syrian government the longer this goeson.'
p2109
aS"And the problem is that we've waited a long time."
p2110
aS'The extremists have the upperhand.'
p2111
aS"And what you're saying, I think, is that we just have to accept that Al-Qaeda andHezbollah should slug it out."
p2112
aS'We say no.'
p2113
aS'There remains a distinct and credible moderateforce within Syria that we have to support and get to the point where they can maketheir own decision.Graham Allison one more --John DonvanYes.'
p2114
aS'Graham Allison.'
p2115
aS'Yes.Graham Allison.'
p2116
aS'[[applause]] Graham AllisonI -- I mean I think Nigel is speaking directly to the point.'
p2117
aS'But I would have to -- FareedZakaria who has been struggling with this a lot -- had a good line recently.'
p2118
aS'And I wonderif you disagree.'
p2119
aS"He says, quote, We want an outcome in Syria that's even moreambitious than the one we sought in Iraq."
p2120
aS'And yet, we imagine that we can get it by ano-fly zone or even less than that.'
p2121
aS"So, do you disagree with that?Nigel SheinwaldI don't disagree fundamentally."
p2122
aS"But I'm just looking at the other comparable examples.And my comparable examples will be not ones very appealing to this audience or to aBritish audience in terms of what we'd want politically."
p2123
aS'But I look at Tunisia.'
p2124
aS'I look atEgypt.'
p2125
aS'I look at Libya.'
p2126
aS"I see all the reasons why it would have been very convenient tokeep the old regimes in power, but I don't see Al-Qaeda in charge in any of those places.And I don't see why that needs to be the case in Syria either.John DonvanWell hear from Richard and then -- Richard Falkenrath.Richard FalkenrathA lot hangs on your assessment of the character of the Syrian state."
p2127
aS'And one of the keydifferences between Tunisia and Egypt, lesser extent Libya, is the sectarian division inSyria is far worse.'
p2128
aS'And so the speed with which the protest took off and the violencetook off was not merely a moderate bourgeois rebellion against an autocrat.'
p2129
aS'It was theemergence of a sectarian conflict which has been suppressed by force by the Alawites, aShiite sect, for years, at least going back to 1970, and where the only other activepolitical entity, the Muslim Brotherhood, was destroyed viciously by Assad in Hama.'
p2130
aS"So,I mean, to say that -- to hang so much on the idea that a moderate Syrian secularleadership and consensus will emerge, as Graham says, that's -- we didn't even developthat in Iraq.John DonvanNick Burns.Nicholas BurnsI think that ---- I think that Graham asked a fair question, and Fareed's a smart guy."
p2131
aS"The difference [[applause]] between the U.S. intervening and Iraq in March 2003 and what we're talking about nowis that the Syrian moderates have a lot more support, frankly, than the United States didgoing into Iraq."
p2132
aS"If you look at Turkey's support, and the support of all the Gulf countries,nearly every other Arab country, all of Europe, and the United States, and Canada, Ithink that's probably the best way for this loose international coalition to succeedeventually in helping the Syrian rebels to stay together and to draw on that internationalunity."
p2133
aS"And remember the question here is not whether we have a vital interest, notwhether we're going to intervene militarily, we're not going to do that, do we care whowins, and do we put our shoulder behind that side, that's what President Obama's saidhe wants to do."
p2134
aS'And I find that logical.John Donvan [[applause]] Right in the center.Lindsay HanahanHi.'
p2135
aS"My name's Lindsay Hanahan , and I'm desperate for some hopehere."
p2136
aS'So we have a new leader in Iran.'
p2137
aS"And I'm hearing this conversation about theproxy fight."
p2138
aS"Does the fact that we have a new leader in Iran give us some possibility he'scome up and said that he is willing to reach out?John DonvanCan you rephrase your question, and I know that you can, that relates it to what -- kindof what the American interest in being involved is?Lindsay HanahanIf we're looking at do we or do we not have a dog in the fight, and part of that hinges onwho that dog is that we're fighting as well, I believe, so I'm saying if who we're fightingchanges in terms of this proxy, do we now have a dog in the fight if Iran pulls out and --John DonvanAnd who's on the other side?Lindsay HanahanWho's on the other side --John DonvanRight, okay.Lindsay Hanahan-- changes.John DonvanGreat, actually really well skillfully done, thank you.Who'd like to take that side first?"
p2139
aS'Richard Falkenrath.'
p2140
aS"[[laughter]] Richard FalkenrathI'm arguing the U.S. has no dog in the fight."
p2141
aS"I don't have a crystal ball but I doubt it."
p2142
aS'Idoubt that the new elected president controls it.'
p2143
aS"It's a longstanding -- I mean, Syria isIran's last friend in the region."
p2144
aS'Their support for Hezbollah goes back to 1982.'
p2145
aS"Syria's thefunnel through which the arms get to Hezbollah."
p2146
aS'And the new president is not, in fact,the supreme leader.'
p2147
aS'The supreme leader is the supreme leader.'
p2148
aS"And so this policyseems pretty well marbled in the Iranian state, and I doubt it will change of its ownaccord just because of an election.John DonvanThe other side, Nick Burns?Nicholas BurnsI think it's a really good question."
p2149
aS"And I don't disagree with Richard."
p2150
aS"I think he's probablyright."
p2151
aS'But there is a -- possibly an opportunity here.'
p2152
aS'Rouhani was inaugurated lastSunday.'
p2153
aS"He's a different guy than Jalili, the former nuclear negotiator."
p2154
aS'The Europeansfound him to be more pragmatic and straightforward when they dealt with him a coupleof years ago.'
p2155
aS"So we've been talking this week at Aspen."
p2156
aS'How should the U.S. approachhim on this subject of Syria on the nuclear question?'
p2157
aS"We ought to give negotiations achance.We haven't had a serious negotiation with Iran and sustained since the Jimmy Carteradministration."
p2158
aS'So we ought to open up a conversation.'
p2159
aS"We may not be able -- probablywon't -- I think Richard's right -- change their minds, but let's put Syria on the table, andlet's let the Iranians know that this is a big deal for us, and for Israel, and for Europe, andsee if we can make some progress there."
p2160
aS"It's at least worth a try.John DonvanThat was a great question."
p2161
aS'Thank you.And, sir, over here, and I think you might be our last question.'
p2162
aS'Jenna, do we have more [[applause]] time after this, or we need to --Arly ShermanMy name is Arly Sherman .'
p2163
aS"As I recall, since I think I'm older thanmost of this group, that Harry Truman said that it was not in our special interests todefend the Korean Peninsula or the Straits of Formosa."
p2164
aS'And it was a green light for theRussians, the Chinese, and everyone to move.'
p2165
aS"Are we not giving a green light now forIran to move and are moving and doing the same thing that Harry Truman did?John DonvanNigel Sheinwald.Nigel SheinwaldWell, that's our worry."
p2166
aS"I mean, that's one of our concerns over this continued stalemate."
p2167
aS"Letting Assad stay in power is de facto -- it's a victory for Iran."
p2168
aS"It extends further theirinfluence because they have thousands of their own people now in Syria in a way thatthey weren't a short while ago."
p2169
aS"And I think that, although I too agree that there's goingto be -- very unlikely to be an immediate change on the Rouhanis part, nevertheless, wewant to create uncertainty in their minds."
p2170
aS'And the uncertainty that Assad may go andthat something different may emerge in Syria.'
p2171
aS"I think it's a good thing in trying to getthem to negotiate seriously with us on the other issues.John DonvanAnd Graham Allison.Graham AllisonWell, I would say in one word, no, okay?"
p2172
aS'The situations are entirely different.'
p2173
aS'There arenumerous places in the world where the U.S. does have vital interests.There usually we have an alliance.'
p2174
aS'For example, Israel we regard as an ally.'
p2175
aS"If there's anattack on an ally we think this reaches the level of a threat to our vital interest, and forthose we are prepared to act."
p2176
aS"There are many, many other situations in the world inwhich we're not prepared to act."
p2177
aS"That doesn't mean that on some occasions we don't."
p2178
aS'North Korea is a good example.'
p2179
aS"But it seems to me that we went around everywheresaying to everyone if something bad happens in Somalia we're going to becomeinvolved militarily."
p2180
aS"If something happens in Sudan we're going to become involvedmilitarily."
p2181
aS"If something happens in Pakistan, where there's an even bigger war right --we're going to become militarily involved."
p2182
aS"We will soon find the U.S. everywhere.John DonvanAnd that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.And here's where we are."
p2183
aS'We are about to hear brief closing statements from each [[applause]] debater in turn.'
p2184
aS'Those closing statements will be two minutes each.'
p2185
aS'Remember howyou voted just before the debate, immediately after these statements we will have youvote again.'
p2186
aS'So, this is their last chance to try to win over your votes.Our motion is this: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p2187
aS'Round three, closingstatements, here to speak first against the motion, Nicholas, you do the -- seated for theclosing statements -- to speak against the motion, Nicholas Burns.'
p2188
aS'He is professor at theHarvard Kennedy School and former undersecretary of state for political affairs.Nicholas BurnsThank you.'
p2189
aS"And I've really enjoyed this debate."
p2190
aS'Thanks to Richard and Graham.'
p2191
aS"Eighteen years ago at the height of the Bosnian war in 1995, I found myself a StateDepartment spokesperson and my job basically was to give daily press conferences anddefend the Clinton administration's foreign policy."
p2192
aS'One of the toughest and mostpainful moments of my entire career came in July of that year when the Bosnian Serbmilitary went through a Dutch U.N. garrison outside the city of Srebrenica.'
p2193
aS'They wentinto the town.'
p2194
aS'They rounded up -- well, they divided the men and the women.'
p2195
aS'Theyrounded up 8,000 men and boys and they shot them.It was the worst massacre in the world since the Nazis massacred European Jewry.'
p2196
aS"AndI had to explain the following days, as did my White House colleague, Mike McCurry,why didn't the United States act?"
p2197
aS"Why weren't we involved?"
p2198
aS"Why hadn't we made surethat the United Nations had a tougher mission in Bosnia?"
p2199
aS"And a lot of us in the Clintonadministration at that time vowed that we would never again stand by with all thepower of the United States and our leadership and let something like that happen.Now we can't be everywhere."
p2200
aS"Graham's right."
p2201
aS"We can't solve the world's problems."
p2202
aS"We're not the world's policemen."
p2203
aS"We can't intervene everywhere."
p2204
aS'But at least we cantry without putting military forces in, to help the people of Syria.'
p2205
aS'The people who aresupporting the rebel groups are the majority in Syria.'
p2206
aS'They deserve a chance.'
p2207
aS'And theapproach that Nigel and I outlined is far better than doing nothing, because if we say wehave no dog in the fight, we consign the Syrian people to the brutalization of the Assadgovernment.'
p2208
aS"We do have a dog in the fight.It's to lead by moral example, to do what we can to help those people survive."
p2209
aS"And itmay be two, three, or four years before they're able to get on their feet, form a newgovernment and kick Assad out, but we need to stay the course with them."
p2210
aS'Thank youvery much.John DonvanThank you.Nicholas Burns.'
p2211
aS"Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria and here to [[applause]] speak in support of the motion, it means he thinks the U.S. has no dog in this fight,Richard Falkenrath, a principle with the Chertoff Group and former deputy homelandsecurity advisor.Richard FalkenrathSo, if we interpret this motion as do we care, there's no difference between the twopanels."
p2212
aS'We do.'
p2213
aS'I think Graham, I, Nick, Nigel, we equally abhor this violence, and if wecould stop this butchery we can, we would.'
p2214
aS'But the proposition before us is what to doabout it.'
p2215
aS"And here, I think you've heard slightly different prescriptions from Nick andNigel and I'm going to choose to focus on the one I heard from Nigel, which I think iscorrect, that a political outcome in Syria requires changing facts on the ground.In order to change the facts on the ground you need to tilt the military balance againstAssad in some way or another."
p2216
aS'That is what we call a proxy war.'
p2217
aS'I have no objection --on a principle basis -- to proxy warfare.'
p2218
aS'But I do, on a pragmatic basis, which is if we aregoing to get into them, we should have a reasonable belief that we can succeed.'
p2219
aS'Andthat, unfortunately, is not the case here.'
p2220
aS"And it's not the case for several differentreasons, one of which is our proxy is not very reliable, and in fact, not very powerful,this moderate opposition."
p2221
aS'Another is the opponent is deeply entrenched and their ownsponsors -- Hezbollah, Iran, Russia -- are completely uninhibited by the strength that wehave.'
p2222
aS'Russia is sending advanced anti-aircraft systems to Syria right now.'
p2223
aS'There -- andapparently lawful under international law.'
p2224
aS"And we can't even -- we struggle overwhether to send light arms.So I think the other side, though they wish to avoid saying we're for military intervention-- in fact, the essence of their political strategy requires a change of the military facts onthe ground."
p2225
aS'And that involves giving military support to the fighters.'
p2226
aS'That is that we calla proxy war.'
p2227
aS'And unless you are very, very sure that you will prevail in the end, it strikesme as an unwise policy.'
p2228
aS'And if you interpret the motion that way, I think you need tosay -- invoke with -- where Graham and I stand.John DonvanThank you, Richard Falkenrath.And our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p2229
aS'And here to speak against [[applause]] this motion -- it means he does think the U.S. has a dog in the fight in Syria -- NigelSheinwald.'
p2230
aS"He's a former British ambassador to the U.S. and foreign policy and defenseadviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair.Nigel SheinwaldLadies and gentlemen, well, thank you very much for listening this evening."
p2231
aS"I'm not agung-ho interventionist."
p2232
aS"I've spent my life being as a pragmatist and a realist aboutthese things."
p2233
aS'And as you mentioned at the beginning, John, six years ago, my primeminister, Tony Blair, sent me to Damascus to try to negotiate with President Assad for abetter, less confrontational relationship between Syria and our countries.And we made a bit of progress.'
p2234
aS'We had a long day of negotiation.'
p2235
aS"We made a bit ofprogress in relation to Syria's relationship with Iraq."
p2236
aS'But on the big issues -- on Iran, onLebanon, on his overall relationship with us, I came away empty-handed.And I concluded two things from that.'
p2237
aS'The first thing was, the importance -- the reallycrucial importance of Syria in its region and internationally.'
p2238
aS"Things won't get done in thisregion -- and America has many interests -- Iran, Israel, much else in the Middle East --without Syria being much more stable, having much better future than it has today."
p2239
aS"Andsecondly, I concluded Assad wouldn't make good choices by himself."
p2240
aS"Unfortunately,things have collapsed significantly since then, because he reacted as badly and unwiselyas he did to the revolution which started in March of 2011.He could have handled it differently, but he chose to terrorize his people, 100,000people said, as we've all said."
p2241
aS'So, I agree with what Rich said earlier.'
p2242
aS"I don't think there'sa difference between us in the sense of do we care."
p2243
aS'Yes, I think we do.'
p2244
aS"It's a questionabout how much and what our tolerance is for allowing the present situation tocontinue, and about whether we really have reacted to the different world in the MiddleEast today and elsewhere, where we can't find perfect situations and where we need tointervene in the best way we can."
p2245
aS'And we think there is a realistic prospect of getting toa position where the Syrians themselves can decide.'
p2246
aS"And that's what we got to back.And that's our dog in the fight.John DonvanThank you."
p2247
aS'Nigel Sheinwald.Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria.'
p2248
aS'And here to speak in support of [[applause]] the motion who says the U.S. does not have a dog in this fight Graham Allison.'
p2249
aS"He isdirector of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and formerassistant secretary of defense.Graham AllisonThank you."
p2250
aS'My old professor, Henry Kissinger, has a cushion in his home office that says,Try to be the person your dog thinks you are.Okay?'
p2251
aS"So, if you find your dog in the fight, you're obliged to do everything you physically [[laughter]] can -- including risks to your own life and limb -- to rescue your dog."
p2252
aS'Okay?'
p2253
aS'I had thatexperience only once.'
p2254
aS'I almost killed a German Shepherd that had its jaws around thethroat of our little Corgi, Annie.'
p2255
aS'And I hope I never have such an experience again.'
p2256
aS"So,that's to have a dog in the fight."
p2257
aS"As you think about your vote tonight, I would say, askthree questions -- I would urge you to consider three questions.First, we are just exiting two wars in which we entered without understanding therealities of the country to which we sent Americans to fight --So, who imagines that we understand what's happening in Syria better than we did in [[applause]] Iraq and Afghanistan?Second question -- this has come up in the debates that we had the Aspen StrategyGroup this week."
p2258
aS"There're almost parallel realities."
p2259
aS'On the one hand, foreign policyexperts look abroad and say, Here dragons: this is a problem, this is a danger.'
p2260
aS'We needto mount an effort.'
p2261
aS"But there's another reality, which is where is this country today?Look at Washington -- not just broke, but broken."
p2262
aS'Stalemated.'
p2263
aS'Unable to even have abudget.'
p2264
aS'And maybe on a drift to a closedown of the government.'
p2265
aS"Is this a governmentthat's ready to engage in yet another military operation?Finally, I would say -- it -- for those of you ---- for those of you that have children or grandchildren, if you imagine that by voting that [[applause]] we have a dog in the fight, you were at risk of sending your daughter or son to Syria,how would you vote?John DonvanGraham Allison, thank you very much."
p2266
aS'Your time.'
p2267
aS'And that concludes our closingstatements.And now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best.'
p2268
aS"We're going to ask [[applause]] you again to go to the keypads at your seat."
p2269
aS"Once again, it's the 1-2-3 vote."
p2270
aS'If you werepersuaded by the side that is arguing that the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria, pushnumber 1.'
p2271
aS"It's this side."
p2272
aS"If you were persuaded by their opponents, who are arguing thatyes, the U.S. does have a dog in the fight in Syria -- that is this side -- push number 2.And if you are undecided, became undecided, or remain undecided, push number 3.And we'll have the results and the announcement of the winner -- according to our rules-- in just about two minutes.And once again, we determine victory by the number of percentage points that hasmoved from one side to the other.All right."
p2273
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to take care of a couple of pleasant pieces ofbusiness.'
p2274
aS'And the main one is to say that the spirit and the honesty and the respect forone another that these debaters brought to the stage is what Intelligence Squared aimsfor.'
p2275
aS'The level of argument was superb and I want to thank them for that.I also want to say that very often, the questions are a problematic area in these debates.'
p2276
aS'[[applause]] They were superb tonight.'
p2277
aS'Every single question was on point.'
p2278
aS"Or if it wasn't, it wasquickly refashioned."
p2279
aS'And it really moved this debate in a better direction.'
p2280
aS"So, I want tothank everybody who had the nerve to get up and ask a question.I also want to thank, for being here with us, some guests that we're delighted to have."
