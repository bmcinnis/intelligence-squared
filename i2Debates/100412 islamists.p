p576

p578

p580
aS'They havelots of cars and planes.'
p581
aS"It's the good life."
p582
aS"They're greedy.And in the pursuit of this greedy goal, they are going to harm you if you get in their way."
p583
aS"But if you don't get in their way, they'll leave you alone."
p584
aS"They don't have a vision."
p585
aS"Theydon't particularly cooperate with each other."
p586
aS"And they often do cooperate with usbecause they don't have any particular hostility towards us so long as we don't get intheir way."
p587
aS"Now, that's bad."
p588
aS"There's no apology from me on that."
p589
aS'But the ideologicaldictators, be they fascist, communist or Islamist are far worse because they wish toimpose their vision.'
p590
aS'They wish to create a global hegemonic state, in this case,Caliphate, another case, an international communist state or Nazi state.'
p591
aS'They have avision for the new human being who they will redo.'
p592
aS"And if you get in their way, they will-- even if you don't get in their way, if you disagree with them, they will be brutal withyou.And if dictators are bad and kill thousands, ideological dictators, Nazis, communists andIslamists kill millions and even tens of millions, tens of millions."
p593
aS'Mao, Stalin, SaddamHussein and so forth.'
p594
aS"These are people with a vision how they're going to changesociety."
p595
aS"So I argue that we're better off with plain old greedy dictators who can evolve,who do evolve if they're pushed, who are not that terrible to their population, who wecan work with."
p596
aS"We're far better off with them than we are with the ideological ones."
p597
aS'Soin short, the motion that\'s before us, "Better --" if you agree with this motion, "BetterElected Islamists Than Dictators," you are in effect saying that you also agree with theidea that the motion, "Better Elected Nazis Than Dictators.'
p598
aS'Adolph Hitler was elected,was he not?'
p599
aS'These are the same people.'
p600
aS'These are totalitarianists.These are people who will limit freedom for a much longer period of time.'
p601
aS"Now, it'strue, as Reuel pointed out, that in 1980, one did not see the Islamist surge in Egypt thatone does today."
p602
aS'No question.'
p603
aS'And I agree with him that the dictatorship was part of it.'
p604
aS'I wish that our government and other Western governments had pushed HosniMubarak to open up.'
p605
aS'And I believe we could have had a quite different outcome hadwe done so.'
p606
aS'We were irresponsible in being his colluders, his accomplices.'
p607
aS'We shouldhave been pushing towards civil society.'
p608
aS'We should have been pushing towards votingand freedom of expression and minority rights and independent judiciary and loyalopposition.'
p609
aS"We should have been doing all those things, and we didn't."
p610
aS'And thus wehave the terrible results we have.'
p611
aS'So my first premise, my first guideline for Americanpolicy is always deal with dictators and push them in the right direction towards an opensociety.Secondly, always support our friends.'
p612
aS'We do have friends.'
p613
aS'We do have people whoagree with us.'
p614
aS'Be they the demonstrators in Iran in June of 2009 who were against thedictatorship of the Mullahs or the people in Tahrir Square last year who were againstMubarak.'
p615
aS"If you listen to them, they're in favor of the things we have."
p616
aS'They wantdemocracy.'
p617
aS'They want civil society.'
p618
aS'They want responsibility.'
p619
aS'And it is our burden notonly to help them materially but to help them morally, to work with them, to always,always help them.'
p620
aS"Even though they're far from the corridors of power and will notachieve -- will not reach rule any time soon, they are the hope for the Middle East."
p621
aS'Theyare the ones who can pull the region out of its current mire, and we must alwayssupport them.So one, work with dictators, but push them towards civil society and democracy.'
p622
aS'Two,always help the liberal elements.'
p623
aS'And three, always, always, always oppose theIslamists.'
p624
aS'They are our worst enemy.'
p625
aS'And whenever they come in, they are our enemy,and they are the enemy of the subjects that they rule over.'
p626
aS'And Reuel mentionedTurkey.'
p627
aS'Yeah, Turkey has become Islamist, as he mentioned.'
p628
aS'For the last 10 years, onesees a Turkey which was always imperfect under the other parties, has under the AKPbecome far more dictatorial than it had been for, far more hostile in its foreign relationswith state actors, states on its peripheries, has the largest number of journalists in theworld that are in jail and the like.'
p629
aS'So in short, if we want to get to liberal democracy,which we all agree upon, the thing to do is to work with the dictators and improve thedictators and slam the door on the totalitarians and the ideological dictators.Work with the greedy dictators and slam the door on the ideological dictators who willput the region into even worse shape than it is today.'

aS"They're interested in their own welfare."
p656
aS'They have huge amounts of money stored away.'
p657
aS'They invite Mariah Carey in to sing their birthday song.'
p658
aS'They keep pet lions in their backyard.'
p659
aS'They have lots of cars and planes.'
p660
aS"It's the good life."
p661
aS"They're greedy."
p662
aS'And in the pursuit of this greedy goal, they are going to harm you if you get in their way.'
p663
aS"But if you don't get in their way, they'll leave you alone."
p664
aS"They don't have a vision."
p665
aS"They don't particularly cooperate with each other."
p666
aS"And they often do cooperate with us because they don't have any particular hostility towards us so long as we don't get in their way."
p667
aS"Now, that's bad."
p668
aS"There's no apology from me on that."
p669
aS'But the ideological dictators, be they fascist, communist or Islamist are far worse because they wish to impose their vision.'
p670
aS'They wish to create a global hegemonic state, in this case, Caliphate, another case, an international communist state or Nazi state.'
p671
aS'They have a vision for the new human being who they will redo.'
p672
aS"And if you get in their way, they will -- even if you don't get in their way, if you disagree with them, they will be brutal with you."
p673
aS'And if dictators are bad and kill thousands, ideological dictators, Nazis, communists and Islamists kill millions and even tens of millions, tens of millions.'
p674
aS'Mao, Stalin, Saddam Hussein and so forth.'
p675
aS"These are people with a vision how they're going to change society."
p676
aS"So I argue that we're better off with plain old greedy dictators who can evolve, who do evolve if they're pushed, who are not that terrible to their population, who we can work with."
p677
aS"We're far better off with them than we are with the ideological ones."
p678
aS'So in short, the motion that\'s before us, "Better --" if you agree with this motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators," you are in effect saying that you also agree with the idea that the motion, "Better Elected Nazis Than Dictators.'
p679
aS'Adolph Hitler was elected, was he not?'
p680
aS'These are the same people.'
p681
aS'These are totalitarianists.'
p682
aS'These are people who will limit freedom for a much longer period of time.'
p683
aS"Now, it's true, as Reuel pointed out, that in 1980, one did not see the Islamist surge in Egypt that one does today."
p684
aS'No question.'
p685
aS'And I agree with him that the dictatorship was part of it.'
p686
aS'I wish that our government and other Western governments had pushed Hosni Mubarak to open up.'
p687
aS'And I believe we could have had a quite different outcome had we done so.'
p688
aS'We were irresponsible in being his colluders, his accomplices.'
p689
aS'We should have been pushing towards civil society.'
p690
aS'We should have been pushing towards voting and freedom of expression and minority rights and independent judiciary and loyal opposition.'
p691
aS"We should have been doing all those things, and we didn't."
p692
aS'And thus we have the terrible results we have.'
p693
aS'So my first premise, my first guideline for American policy is always deal with dictators and push them in the right direction towards an open society.'
p694
aS'Secondly, always support our friends.'
p695
aS'We do have friends.'
p696
aS'We do have people who agree with us.'
p697
aS'Be they the demonstrators in Iran in June of 2009 who were against the dictatorship of the Mullahs or the people in Tahrir Square last year who were against Mubarak.'
p698
aS"If you listen to them, they're in favor of the things we have."
p699
aS'They want democracy.'
p700
aS'They want civil society.'
p701
aS'They want responsibility.'
p702
aS'And it is our burden not only to help them materially but to help them morally, to work with them, to always, always help them.'
p703
aS"Even though they're far from the corridors of power and will not achieve -- will not reach rule any time soon, they are the hope for the Middle East."
p704
aS'They are the ones who can pull the region out of its current mire, and we must always support them.'
p705
aS'So one, work with dictators, but push them towards civil society and democracy.'
p706
aS'Two, always help the liberal elements.'
p707
aS'And three, always, always, always oppose the Islamists.'
p708
aS'They are our worst enemy.'
p709
aS'And whenever they come in, they are our enemy, and they are the enemy of the subjects that they rule over.'
p710
aS'And Reuel mentioned Turkey.'
p711
aS'Yeah, Turkey has become Islamist, as he mentioned.'
p712
aS'For the last 10 years, one sees a Turkey which was always imperfect under the other parties, has under the AKP become far more dictatorial than it had been for, far more hostile in its foreign relations with state actors, states on its peripheries, has the largest number of journalists in the world that are in jail and the like.'
p713
aS'So in short, if we want to get to liberal democracy, which we all agree upon, the thing to do is to work with the dictators and improve the dictators and slam the door on the totalitarians and the ideological dictators.'
p714
aS'Work with the greedy dictators and slam the door on the ideological dictators who will put the region into even worse shape than it is today.'
p715
aS'Thank you.'

aS"It's really great to be here tonight, and I can promise in this debate we'renot going to talk about the debt, I'm not going to talk about my grandmother, I'm notgoing to talk about your tax rates, we've got a really juicy topic.And I'm going to break it down into three main points, why you should vote in favor ofthe proposition and not against us."
p750
aS'Number one, no dictatorship can maintain thestatus quo that we see in the Middle East right now.'
p751
aS'A vote for the proposition wouldbe a vote to accept reality.'
p752
aS'A vote against the proposition is a vote to stick your headiuin the sand.'
p753
aS"Although I suspect much of the debate tonight will focus on the Middle Eastand North Africa, it's important to note that this region of the world actually representsa minority in the vast Muslim world."
p754
aS"It's about 20 percent of the entire population ofMuslims in the world."
p755
aS'Six in 10 Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region.'
p756
aS'Muslimmajority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have activist Islamist political parties andsystems that work.'
p757
aS"So the debate over whether Islam and democracy is compatible isthe persistent charm of an irrelevant question, one that's no longer relevant.In the Middle East right now we're in the very early stages of a transition that I think willlast for years."
p758
aS"And a year and a half into these uprisings we've only seen four leaders fallout of about 19 or 20, depending how you add them up."
p759
aS"And you've seen only seriousinfighting in the five or six countries, but you look at the crushing demographic politicaland economic conditions that these countries face, no dictator can hold that back."
p760
aS"And Ithink you look at the political dynamics in places like Egypt and Tunisia, it's quite naturalto see why Islamists did very well for reasons that were well explained."
p761
aS'They weresuppressed, and the debates in these societies were pushed to the dark corners of themosques.'
p762
aS'And that debate was radicalized, and, yes, there is a threat from radicalizedIslam.'
p763
aS"But it is the consequence of dictatorships, the very thing that if you vote againstthe proposition you will be voting in favor of that and continuing that sort of system.It's simply not sustainable."
p764
aS'Number two, elected Islamists will change in response to thepolitics.'
p765
aS"And I think tonight we'll talk a lot about statements that elected Islamists willsay."
p766
aS"What I'm focused on are the people, and I lived over there, and I understand thatthe basic needs, basic security, jobs, and other things will drive politics, maybe not inthe early stages, maybe when things get a little rough they'll be a little ideological, but,by and large, Islamist politicians will be politicians, and we will need to support this longeffort to actually push them to face the same pressures and constraints that otherpoliticians face around the world."
p767
aS"And the open debates that we have like the opendebate we're having here tonight in Intelligence Squared, I think this forum isphenomenal."
p768
aS"I've watched it now a number of times."
p769
aS'And these sorts of open debatesexpose the voices of fear, expose the voices of hatred and demonization in ways that Ithink clarify.And this is what these societies in the Middle East are just starting to experience.'
p770
aS'So,again, a vote for the proposition is a vote for the possibility of change in these societies.'
p771
aS"A vote against it, it's for the status quo, which, as we said, is unsustainable and hasharmed us."
p772
aS'Now, I hope we get into this debate over a liberal democracy.'
p773
aS'You talkedabout it a little bit early on.'
p774
aS"And certainly we shouldn't be nave."
p775
aS"There's a very real riskthat if we simplistically define democracy as the ballot box and going to the ballot box,you could see Christian minorities, other religious minorities, women see their rightssuffer."
p776
aS"But my argument, again, against that and against the arguments of one man,one vote, one time, which is often brought up, is that that threat in the context of thisdebate tonight, the proposition you have to vote for or against, there's an inherentcontradiction there, because if the biggest threat resulting from elected Islamists is adictatorship that imposes upon the human rights and basic rights of individuals, you'vegot a dictatorship.So at the core of the argument of our opponents tonight is that contradiction we needto deal with."
p777
aS'Third point, elected Islamists, not dictators, will defeat the radicalideologies of groups like al-Qaida.'
p778
aS"Now, I think we've done a damn good job over thelast three or four years going after al-Qaida, and I know that's a debatable propositionamong a lot of people."
p779
aS"But I think the targeted strikes and other things, that's aseparate debate, which I hope Intelligence Squared has."
p780
aS"But if you look at what's goingon ideologically in the battle of ideas, al-Qaida, over the last three decades, essentially,has tried to build its ideological platform on two core pillars."
p781
aS'Number one, tapping thepopular discontent with dictators.'
p782
aS'Number two, anti-Americanism.'
p783
aS"That's acombustible mix, and breaking that, and having the people in the region break that, Ithink, is extremely powerful.The fact that al-Qaida and its affiliates had virtually nothing with the removal of leadersin places like Egypt and Tunisia and the widespread calls for political reform and thebattles that are still going, I think, is telling."
p784
aS'The fact that Ayman Zawahiri, the head ofal-Qaida, wrote a book attacking the Muslim Brotherhood for actually participating indemocratic politics is telling.'
p785
aS"Looking ahead, it seems that al-Qaida's popular appeal, Ithink, will remain low, given that many of the protesters are out there supportingdemocratic reforms."
p786
aS"People are going to the ballot box, the very thing that radicaljihadists are opposed to.So I'm going to close up here."
p787
aS"I must say that we're faced with a great opportunity here."
p788
aS'The popular uprisings in the Middle East.'
p789
aS"And, again, we'll probably focus on that,because it's the hot topic, and it's the most uncertain, and Reuel and I agree that there'sno clear path forward."
p790
aS"And I think we're probably going to have a couple of steps back.We're going to see these countries fight with this all along."
p791
aS'But tonight, if you voteagainst this motion, your vote is essentially saying -- remember those good old dayswhen Muammar Gaddafi was in power in Libya?'
p792
aS'Remember those good old days?'
p793
aS'Remember when he repressed and killed thousands of his own citizens, when heactually used the veil of Islamism at different times and passed laws in the name ofIslam to try to establish his credibility?'
p794
aS"Remember Muammar Gaddafi used terroristswho actually bombed airlines and killed hundreds of Americans around the world,setting off the sorts of things that I think we're debating here tonight."
p795
aS'Remember that?'
p796
aS'Then vote against the proposition.'
p797
aS"A vote for the proposition, is it a clear, certainproposition that we're going to see liberal democracy appear?"
p798
aS"I can't guarantee youthat."
p799
aS"But I actually think it's a better pathway forward than sticking with dictatorships."

p900
aS'Daniel covered the history and the choicesbefore us in the Middle East.'
p901
aS"I'll give you a deeper, more personal analysis of, really,one of the terms that I think has been thrown around here quite a bit, but, yet, itdoesn't seem that our opposition understands, which is Islamism."
p902
aS'And this motion, Icannot tell you enough, as a Muslim and as an American, how important it is that wenot get this wrong, because we\'re sitting right now at a tipping point in the Middle East,and if we get this wrong and we start to think, "Well, the Islamists are better than thedictators," we\'re going to then usher in even worse totalitarianism and dictatorship.You know, one of the old sayings was that hope springs eternal.'
p903
aS"And certainly one ofthe American concepts we've always had is that we want to be hopeful; we want to seeprogress."
p904
aS"But I'll tell you, as a Muslim, I'm insulted at people who believe that Islamismis progress for me as a Muslim, that somehow the theocrats and those with robes thatmemorize their scripture, that somehow know how to run democracy, when, in fact, it'san illusion."
p905
aS"I think one of the things our opposition hasn't even begun to tell you is howthey can trust one word that the Islamists tell them."
p906
aS"They're deceptive theocrats whowill do anything to monopolize and control our societies.And I think one of the things our opposition seems to be doing -- and if you vote for thismotion, you'd be basically voting for the fact that, somehow, they want you to believethat we support dictators."
p907
aS"And that's not why I'm on this side."
p908
aS"I'm on this side of thisequation because Islamists are not better than dictators, because we have beensentenced to two evils in the Middle East: Islamic fascism and secular fascism.They both supported one another."
p909
aS'They fed off one another.'
p910
aS"They're one and thesame."
p911
aS"And for our opposition to tell you that, somehow, boom, the dictators exit stageleft, and what you're left with is a spring that you can plant new plants and soil, andsomehow that the Islamists, that somehow they come out of reform, is just hogwash."
p912
aS'The Islamists are a product of dictatorship, as, actually, they said.'

aS"So now, all of asudden, we're going to put our hope for reform into not only people the people thatcame out of that environment, but people that have thrived in monopolizing andfeeding off of a dictatorial mindset."

aS'But add one more very important component, asense that they have a mandate from God, a sense that they know our faith.'
p915
aS"They knowIslam, and they know how to put into place Sharia or Islamic law, and they will do it notonly for their country, they'll do it for the 56 other countries in the OIC, the Organizationof the Islamic Cooperation, and they'll thus do it for the world.This is far more dangerous than a simple dictator."
p916
aS"So you need to understand whatIslamism is if you're going to vote for or against this motion."
p917
aS"And once you understandthat Islamism is no different than what our Founding Fathers fought against when wefought against theocracy in this country, you'll realize that fighting against theocracy isthe only way to achieve liberty."

p919
aS'We understand what it is.'

aS'And you see it today with over 30,000killed and hundreds of thousands of displaced.'
p921
aS"But American influence -- please don'tunderestimate the influence that America can have if we try to tip this equation oneway or the other."
p922
aS"And if you believe that there's a third pathway for Muslims and for allthose minorities and women and others in the Middle East, then you must vote againstthis motion.You must vote that Islamists are not better than dictators."
p923
aS'They come from the samecloth.'
p924
aS'And Islamists actually -- actually are dictators on steroids.'
p925
aS"You know, ultimately, Ithink we have to remember that if you're going to vote with the opposition for thismotion, you're going to believe that somehow you can have hope with Islamists."
p926

p930
aS'Forget thefact that women have less and less rights the more the clerics get in control.'
p931
aS"Forget thefact that the minorities are ousted, the fact that the Jewish population and Coptics andothers, the more Islamists get in control, the more minorities vacate the premises inthose countries.Somehow we need to divorce ourselves from the reality of what Islamists do and saythat they're a gateway into a future of hope for the Middle East."
p932
aS"That's certainly not agate that I want to walk through."
p933
aS"And it's certainly, I don't think, a gate that the peoplethat are giving their lives in the Arab revolutions, in the Arab Spring, which are really justconvulsions against dictators, the people that are marching on the streets are not doingthat to be handed over to Islamists."
p934
aS'And if they did -- if you vote for this motion, youare basically telling them that, okay, this dictator, this theocrat, because he usesreligious language, is better for you.'
p935
aS"And we're going to help them."
p936
aS"And by the way, ifyou believe in American credibility and soft power, American soft power in the MiddleEast is lower than it's ever been."
p937
aS'The reason Secretary Clinton had tomatoes thrown ather car a few months ago was because the people of the Arab Spring saw us helping outthe Brotherhood, saw us basically cozying up to the Islamists.'
p938
aS'And the Islamists did notwin that election.'
p939
aS"They only got 25 percent of the vote, and then there was a runoff.So remember the elections, that's the other part of this motion."
p940
aS'We have to also look atwhat it means to be elected.'
p941
aS'The non-Islamists are divided into so many parties that themajority, 75 percent of Egypt and a majority of Tunisians did not vote with the Islamiststhe first time around.'
p942
aS'But then when a runoff happened, they ended up voting betweenthe Islamists or the old dictators, and they wanted some kind of change shall and theyended up voting for the Islamists.'
p943
aS"So that's the other thing is, if you want to resign themto just two choices, both of which none of us want, I think ultimately you must vote for."
p944
aS'If you want to give them a third choice, a third path, that being of liberty, I believe youshould vote against.'
p945
aS"And you'll not see the Egypt Islamist President Morsi, for example,criticizing terrorist groups like Hamas or Iran or Saudi Arabia, even though he may giveflowery language of parliamentary democracies and talking about women's rights, etcetera.But yet when push comes to shove -- just a few years ago, he was a truther, a conspiracytheorist."
p946
aS"Just a few years ago -- and just actually a few months ago, he's already metwith the heads of Hamas and other radical Islamists."
p947
aS"So this is a guy who's consolidatinghis power, not only in Egypt, but globally."
p948
aS'Islamism is what pushes him to consolidatepower globally.'

p961
aS"I'll give you a deeper, more personal analysis of, really, one of the terms that I think has been thrown around here quite a bit, but, yet, it doesn't seem that our opposition understands, which is Islamism."
p962
aS'And this motion, I cannot tell you enough, as a Muslim and as an American, how important it is that we not get this wrong, because we\'re sitting right now at a tipping point in the Middle East, and if we get this wrong and we start to think, "Well, the Islamists are better than the dictators," we\'re going to then usher in even worse totalitarianism and dictatorship.'
p963
aS'You know, one of the old sayings was that hope springs eternal.'
p964
aS"And certainly one of the American concepts we've always had is that we want to be hopeful; we want to see progress."
p965
aS"But I'll tell you, as a Muslim, I'm insulted at people who believe that Islamism is progress for me as a Muslim, that somehow the theocrats and those with robes that memorize their scripture, that somehow know how to run democracy, when, in fact, it's an illusion."
p966
aS"I think one of the things our opposition hasn't even begun to tell you is how they can trust one word that the Islamists tell them."
p967
aS"They're deceptive theocrats who will do anything to monopolize and control our societies."
p968
aS"And I think one of the things our opposition seems to be doing -- and if you vote for this motion, you'd be basically voting for the fact that, somehow, they want you to believe that we support dictators."
p969
aS"And that's not why I'm on this side."
p970
aS"I'm on this side of this equation because Islamists are not better than dictators, because we have been sentenced to two evils in the Middle East: Islamic fascism and secular fascism."
p971
aS'They both supported one another.'
p972
aS'They fed off one another.'
p973
aS"They're one and the same."
p974
aS"And for our opposition to tell you that, somehow, boom, the dictators exit stage left, and what you're left with is a spring that you can plant new plants and soil, and somehow that the Islamists, that somehow they come out of reform, is just hogwash."
p975
aS'The Islamists are a product of dictatorship, as, actually, they said.'
p976
aS"So now, all of a sudden, we're going to put our hope for reform into not only people the people that came out of that environment, but people that have thrived in monopolizing and feeding off of a dictatorial mindset."
