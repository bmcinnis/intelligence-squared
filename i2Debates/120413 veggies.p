aS'Gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues.'
p452
aS"I'm going to talk about health."
p453
aS'In 2009, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a massive research study.'
p454
aS'The NIH-AARP study had a half a million participants.'
p455
aS'They were followed for 10 years.'
p456
aS"Some of them didn't eat meat or didn't eat very much."
p457
aS'Some ate quite a lot of meat.'
p458
aS'And what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women.'
p459
aS'And in 2012, the Archives of Internal Medicine published another study.'
p460
aS'One hundred and twenty thousand people.'
p461
aS'This was coordinated all at Harvard University.'
p462
aS'And it showed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher.'
p463
aS"And studies have clearly shown that people who don't eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent."
p464
aS'Well, why would meat be linked to cancer?'
p465
aS'Hold that thought for a second.'
p466
aS'I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and I come from a long line of cattle ranchers.'
p467
aS'My dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as I can trace.'
p468
aS'Now, my dad did not like the cattle business.'
p469
aS'He objected to it a great deal.'
p470
aS'He went to medical school.'
p471
aS'He spent his life treating diabetes in Fargo, North Dakota.'
p472
aS'But we still ate like we were in the cattle business.'
p473
aS'Every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas.'
p474
aS'And my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented, and he died.'
p475
aS'And we took that as normal because he was old.'
p476
aS'He was 65.'
p477
aS'My other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died.'
p478
aS'And none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this.'
p479
aS'Now, I got my first wake-up call at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, where I was the autopsy assistant.'
p480
aS"One day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story."
p481
aS'And the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that I was headed for medical school.'
p482
aS'So he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, "Look inside.'
p483
aS'" And it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when I felt it, it was hard like a rock.'
p484
aS'And he said, "That\'s atherosclerosis.'
p485
aS"That's your morning sausage, Neal."
p486
aS"That's your bacon, Neal."
p487
aS"That's your roast beef in there."
p488
aS'" And he said, "We see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23," which happened to be the age I was at the time.'
p489
aS'And he wrote up all his findings.'
p490
aS'He left the room.'
p491
aS'And I had to clean up.'
p492
aS'I took the ribs.'
p493
aS'I put them back in the chest.'
p494
aS'I tried to make them fit with the other ribs.'
p495
aS'And I sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and I went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch.'
p496
aS'Now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little -- a few years later Dr. Dean Ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before.'
p497
aS'The arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications.'
p498
aS'Grass-fed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised.'
p499
aS"It just doesn't work."
p500
aS"Eating chicken and eating fish just can't do that."
p501
aS'And so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and NIH funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes.'
p502
aS'And it works better than any other diet.'
p503
aS'Why?'
p504
aS'Because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories.'
p505
aS"That's its job."
p506
aS'You get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories.'
p507
aS'Meat has zero fiber, none.'
p508
aS'Fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have dont have it, youre going to eat too much, and youre going to gain weight.'
p509
aS'Why diabetes?'
p510
aS'Because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own.'
p511
aS'And we saw something I never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving, sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes.'
p512
aS'And when we look at broad population studies, the meat-eaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest.'
p513
aS'Diabetes is the same way.'
p514
aS'Its about 8 percent of adult meat-eaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent.'
p515
aS'High blood pressure, exactly the same.'
p516
aS'You just dont see it very much in people following vegetarian diets.'
p517
aS'But why more cancer?'
p518
aS'Well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesnt happen with plant foods, and thats that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is.'
p519
aS'But thats not the only carcinogen.'
p520
aS'We also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, theres heme iron, there are a lot of things.'
p521
aS'Plus meat doesnt have fiber that protects you.'
p522
aS'It doesnt have any vitamin C. Its low in important antioxidants.'
p523
aS'So its like tobacco.'
p524
aS'We know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but were not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible.'
p525
aS'We know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body.'
p526
aS'The stomach, the intestinal tract -- but were not sure.'
p527
aS'Is it the HCAs?'
p528
aS'The PAHs?'
p529
aS'Were not quite sure yet.'
p530
aS'I asked Dr. Richard Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat- eating?'
p531
aS'And he said humans are naturally primates.'
p532
aS'Were great apes.'
p533
aS'We are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the Stone Age gave us stone tools, and meat-eating began, he believes, as scavenging.'
p534
aS'Lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had.'
p535
aS'Problem: we have pre-Stone Age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat.'
p536
aS'Of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesnt matter, but if you live to a mid-age and beyond, then these things matter a lot.'
p537
aS'And what matters now is Alzheimers disease.'
p538
aS'We have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat -- thats the bad fat in meat -- is linked to Alzheimers disease in studies in Chicago, in New York, in Finland.'
p539
aS'And meat-eaters actually have very poor nutrition.'
p540
aS'Yes, they get protein, but they dont get many vitamins, they dont get any complex carbohydrates, theyre missing fiber.'
p541
aS'A vegetarian diet gives you all the protein youre going to need, plus many more vitamins, many more minerals.'
p542
aS'So Bill Clinton did.'
p543
aS'Al Gore did it.'
p544
aS'Bob Barker did it.'
p545
aS'Serena Williams did it.'
p546
aS'Since 2004 meat-eating has dropped by 9 percent.'

p668
aS'Tonight my partner Joel Salatin and I will urge you to vote against the motion, "Dont Eat Anything with a Face.'
p669
aS'" Id like to begin by telling you a personal story.'
p670
aS'When I was 18, I became a vegetarian, because I believed that this would be the most healthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice I could make.'
p671
aS'Six months later I became a vegan, meaning I excluded all animal products from my diet.'
p672
aS'After all, I had to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic.'
p673
aS'All animals die regardless of whether we kill them, and what I opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seen in the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than it is for animals raised for meat.'
p674
aS'Im sure that my opponent, Gene, will explain some of this abuse to you later tonight.'
p675
aS'A year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journey through vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land of vibrant health.'
p676
aS'Many pre-existing health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance to me in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my day-to-day function.'
p677
aS'My digestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed.'
p678
aS'Intense exercise began giving my anxiety and heart palpitations.'
p679
aS'In a single dental examination, I found out that I had over a dozen cavities and needed two root canals.'
p680
aS'Worst of all, my anxiety disorders aggravated to the point that I had several panic attacks per week and was often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car.'
p681
aS'But then I encountered the work of Weston Price, which really changed my life.'
p682
aS'Weston Price was the first research director for what became the American Dental Association and was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology.'
p683
aS'He documented -- all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes and latitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds -- the consistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he called the displacing foods of modern commerce: white flower, white sugar, white rice, vegetable oils, and canned goods.'
p684
aS'In every case, the transition was one from radiant and vibrant health to not only tooth decay and dental deformities, but often to tuberculosis, cancer, ulcers, appendicitis, cystitis, gallbladder disease, physical degeneration of all kinds.'
p685
aS'All of the groups that successfully maintained vibrant health on their traditional diets placed special emphasis on the need for animal products rich in fat-soluble vitamins.'
p686
aS'Some groups emphasized dairy products, others emphasized organ meats and egg yolks, others the animal life of the sea, and yet others small animals and insects.'
p687
aS'Price went on to provide laboratory and clinical evidence that the emphasis on these foods was in fact a critical reason for the success of these traditional diets.'
p688
aS"After reading Price's work, I began emphasizing high-quality, nutrient-dense animal foods in my own diet, and within months my anxiety disorders completely disappeared, and my tooth decay came to a crashing halt."
p689
aS'I truly felt like a new person.'
p690
aS'Indeed, my mental and physical health had undergone a revolution.'
p691
aS'My experience raises two questions: First, am I alone in it?'
p692
aS'And second, what happened to me and why?'
p693
aS"The scientific literature shows that I'm not alone."
p694
aS'Seven out of eight relevant studies found that compared to omnivores, vegetarians have a greater risk of mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, poor self-esteem, anxiety, and contemplated or attempted suicide.'
p695
aS'A study published in 2010 found that compared to omnivores, vegans had eight times more lesions involving poor mineralization of the teeth.'
p696
aS'Why might this be?'
p697
aS'Well, simply put, many nutrients are much easier to get from animal products than from plant products.'
p698
aS'Perhaps the most underappreciated of these is cholesterol.'
p699
aS'Many people are aware that high cholesterol is associated with heart disease.'
p700
aS'But few people are aware that low cholesterol is associated with mental disorders, violent and self-injurious behavior, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and increased total mortality.'
p701
aS'Dr. Barnard himself has published scientific papers showing that, although his diet leads to increased intakes of many nutrients, primarily from fruits and vegetables, it also leads to decreased intakes of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and selenium, and fails to guarantee an adequate intake of zinc.'
p702
aS"Dr. Barnard recommends supplementing with vitamin B12 and vitamin D and emphasizing vegan foods rich in zinc, but the foods richest in zinc aren't vegan at all."
p703
aS"They're oysters, beef, and cheese."
p704
aS'It is unlikely that supplementing our way out of these nutrient deficiencies, moreover, will be a complete success, because all of these nutrients have very complex interactions with the other components present in the foods in which we find them.'
p705
aS'Vitamin B12, for example, synergizes with key amino acids found most abundantly in meat, bones, and skin.'
p706
aS'Is it possible to design an adequate diet that does not include the meat of animals with faces?'
p707
aS'I actually think that it is.'
p708
aS'It would include egg yolks, dairy products and shellfish.'
p709
aS"Shellfish are neither vegan nor vegetarian, after all; they're animals."
p710
aS"But many people might argue, perhaps correctly, that they don't have faces."
p711
aS'Such a diet, however, would not be adequate for everyone.'
p712
aS'Let me provide, by way of example for now, just one reason why: Vitamin A. Vitamin A is found most abundantly in liver and cod liver oil or the liver oils of other fishes, while more moderate amounts are found in egg yolks and butter fat.'
p713
aS'Red, orange, yellow and green vegetables provide carotenoids such as beta- carotene which we can convert into vitamin A.'
p714
aS'However, the efficiency of this conversion is relatively poor and highly variable.'
p715
aS'Half of people with European ancestry have a genetic variant that cuts their ability to make the conversion in half, and a third, other variant that cuts it fourfold.'
p716
aS'These people are extremely unlikely to get enough vitamin A from plant foods alone and would do best if they included liver or cod liver oil in their diet which are derived from animals with faces.'
p717
aS'In order to construct an optimal dietary approach that is robust to error and adaptable to individual needs, we need to abandon the false dichotomy between healthy plant foods and supposedly unhealthy animal foods, and instead embrace the health value of high-quality, nutrient-dense foods of all types.'
p718
aS'Fortunately, animal foods are highest in quality and richest in nutrients when the animals are raised in an ethical and ecologically conscious manner, with high-quality soil, out on pasture in the fresh air and sunshine.'
p719

p732
aS'WhenI was 18, I became a vegetarian, because I believed that this would be the mosthealthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice I could make.'
p733
aS'Six monthslater I became a vegan, meaning I excluded all animal products from my diet.'
p734
aS'After all, Ihad to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic.'
p735
aS'All animals die regardless ofwhether we kill them, and what I opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seenin the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than itis for animals raised for meat.'
p736
aS'Im sure that my opponent, Gene, will explain some ofthis abuse to you later tonight.A year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journeythrough vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land ofvibrant health.'
p737
aS'Many pre-existing health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance tome in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my day-to-day function.'
p738
aS'Mydigestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed.'
p739
aS'Intense exercisebegan giving my anxiety and heart palpitations.'

p741
aS'Worst of all, myanxiety disorders aggravated to the point that I had several panic attacks per week andwas often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car.But then I encountered the work of Weston Price, which really changed my life.'
p742
aS'WestonPrice was the first research director for what became the American Dental Associationand was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology.He documented -- all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes andlatitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds -- theconsistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he calledthe displacing foods of modern commerce: white flower, white sugar, white rice,vegetable oils, and canned goods.'

p822

p823
aS"And, you know, when people see this, they don't like it."
p824
aS'And oftentimes people say, "Don\'t tell me.'
p825
aS'I don\'t want to know," when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy.'
p826
aS'When we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people, and we see them suffer, we feel something.'
p827
aS"That is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else's face."
p828
aS"When the executioners at the Salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, Don't look into their face, because if you do, they'll cast a spell on you, and you won't be able to kill them."
p829
aS"Basically, when you look into their face, there's empathy, there's a connection, there's an understanding that there's a living creature there."

p838
aS"They've never gone out and drowned in the rain."

aS'Number one: affirmative studies, affirmative studies impugning animal farming or omnivorous nutrition must be based on pasture-based data, not chemical, pharmaceutical, concentrated animal feeding operations, like CAFOs.'
p980
aS'On our farm, the nutrient difference in folate -- just pick one nutrient -- between a USDA-blessed -- we call it the "U.S. duh" -- The USDA-blessed egg at 47 micrograms and a Polyface-pastured egg at 1,200 micrograms are incomparable.'

aS'The affirmative promotes a segregated view toward life.'
p988
aS'Chris and I promote an integrated view.'
p989
aS'Number three: The motion before you does not allow for climate, cultural, economic, or hunger contingencies.'
p990
aS'An essential thing: the affirmative has not asked for any contingencies.'
p991
aS'If the affirmative wanted some contingencies, they should have worded the resolution or not agreed to their position.'
p992
aS"Chris and I will hold them to the motion's clarity."
p993
aS"Number four: Domestic livestock are owned by 60 percent of the world's poor, primarily because they represent portable wealth to the unlanded poor and nutrition density protected from spoilage and vermin."
p994
aS"The affirmative position is a direct attack on the world's poor."
p995
aS'Number five: Not a single affirmative study assumes modern, pasture-based models, using high-tech electric fencing, portable shade cloth shelters, permaculture, hydration techniques, or cottage-based, localized processing infrastructure.'
p996
aS'This oversight dooms every affirmative conclusion to obsolescence.'
p997
aS'Number six: Life requires death.'
p998
aS'The fact that all of us can come to this luxurious room, comfortable and well-fed, and entertain ourselves by debating whether we should viscerally and actively participate in our role on an ecological continuum is bizarre.'
p999

aS'Number eight: Humans are the ultimate caretaker species, and the notion that my dog is my uncle is my cat is my child does not indicate an evolutionary newfound state of heightened spiritual cosmic awareness, but rather a profound devolution into ignorance and disconnection to our ecological umbilical.'
p1004
aS'Number nine: Killing and eating are interchangeable.'
p1005
aS'If it is wrong to eat, then it is wrong to kill.'
p1006
aS'Killing without eating is an insult to life and resource.'
p1007
aS'Number ten: Environmental integrity demands certain patterns whether we like them or not.'
p1008

aS'The biomass grows slowly at first, then rapidly, then goes into senescence.'
p1021
aS'The herbivore prunes the senescence biomass back to restart the rapid growth cycle.'
p1022
aS'Predation -- both carnivorous and otherwise, like weather or fire -- creates movement patterns, even intensifying herbivores into mobs.'
p1023
aS'All fertile soils have been built with perennials, herbivores, and predators, not tillage and annuals, like wheat and corn.'
p1024
aS'By practicing this mob stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization, our farm is growing soil, growing organic matter, healing the water cycle, and pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.'
p1025
aS'Every single nook and cranny on the planet is full of animals.'
p1026
aS'Why?'
p1027
aS'Because they convert biomass into soil.'

aS'The principle of life requiring death or sacrifice is a most profound spiritual and ecological truth.'
p1033
aS'How we treat the plant and animal in life impart sacredness to the sacrifice.'
p1034
aS'The reason herbivores and seafood form the basis of all diets in antiquity is because these were the only nutrient-rich options that didnt require tillage and storage.'
p1035
aS'Until mechanization and cheap energy, tillage was extremely laborious.'
p1036

p1040
aS'Predation.'

aS'The most efficacious way to remediate environmental degradation while producing the nutrition required by our human population is to embrace animal husbandry in a biomimicry paradigm: perennial, animal, predator.'

S'Thank you, Gene Bauer.'
p4166
aS'And that concludes our closing statements, and now its time to learn which side has argued the best.'
p4167
aS'Were going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat to register your vote on this motion after having heard all of these arguments.'
p4168
aS'The motion is, "Dont Eat Anything with a Face.'
p4169
aS'" If you now embrace this motion, as stated, push number one -- if youre with this side, push number one; if youre against it, with this side, push number two; and if you became or remain undecided, push number three.'
p4170
aS'And we will have the results in about 90 seconds.'
p4171
aS'Before that happens, one thing Id like to do, first of all, is to ask all of you to show your appreciation for four debaters who took this into really interesting areas.'
p4172
aS'And, as an audience, asking audience questions, they were all really good tonight, and to the young man whose question I passed on, I just want to say, I apologize that I couldnt take it, but for you to get up took a lot of guts.'
p4173
aS'So congratulations to you.'
p4174
aS'And we always like it when former debaters come back to sit in the audience, and we have Sheldon Krimsky here, who was here last year arguing -- He argued one of our toughest ethical debates, where the motion was, Prohibit Genetically Engineered Children, and I bet Sheldon fixed it -- a bow.'
p4175
aS'I bet its a lot easier to -- A lot easier to watch from there than to be up here.'
p4176
aS'Wed love it if you tweeted about this debate tonight.'
p4177
aS'Remember our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, and our hash tag is #VEGDEBATE.'
p4178
aS'Our next season starts back here in January.'
p4179
aS"We're starting on the 15th."
p4180
aS'The motion that night will be, "Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue.'
p4181
aS'" For the motion, Dr. Scott Gottlieb -- he\'s a practicing physician and former FDA deputy commissioner.'
p4182
aS'His partner is Megan Mcardle, a columnist for Bloomberg View, who writes on economic business and public policy.'
p4183
aS"Opposing them, and supporting the rescuability of Obamacare, Jonathan Chait -- he's a commentator and writer for New York Magazine -- and Dr. Douglas Kamerow."
p4184
aS'He is a professor of family medicine at Georgetown and a former assistant surgeon general.'
p4185
aS"The rest of our spring topics, going from January through May, will be -- we're going to cover labor unions, affirmative action on campus, targeted killing of U.S. citizens, Russia, MOOCs (massive online open courses), where we're looking at whether online is the future of universities, millennials, and death."
p4186
aS'Tickets for all of our spring debates are on sale now through our website, www.iq2us.org.'
p4187
aS"And for those who can't join our live audience, there are a lot of other ways to catch the debates."
p4188
aS'You can watch the live stream, as I mentioned a few times tonight, on iq2us.org or on FORA.tv.'
p4189
aS'And you can listen to the debates on NPR stations across the country.'
p4190
aS'You can check your local listings for air dates and times.'
p4191
aS'And make sure to visit our website for up-to-date information.'
p4192
aS'Stay in touch with us on Twitter and Facebook, because we welcome your feedback.'
p4193
aS'And we do take ideas.'
p4194
aS'We put debates on stage that have come from audience members.'
p4195
aS"And one other thing, I only wanted to mention this after the vote was in because I wasn't sure how, if at all, it might sway your vote."
p4196
aS"But Joel Salatin's neck tie, it looks like just polka dots to you."
p4197
aS'Those are all little piggies.'
p4198
aS'Each one of those.'
p4199
aS"But it can't change anything now."
p4200
aS'Because the results are all in.'
p4201
aS'You have now heard the arguments.'
p4202
aS'You have voted twice, once before the arguments and once after.'
p4203
aS'And as we count this, the team that has changed the most minds in percentage point terms will be declared our winner.'
p4204
aS'So here are the results: The motion, "Dont Eat Anything with a Face.'
p4205
aS'" Before the debate, in polling the live audience, 24 percent agreed with this motion, 51 percent were against, and 25 percent were undecided.'
p4206
aS'So those are the first results.'
p4207
aS'Remember, you have to have beaten -- you have to have moved your number in percentage point terms by the most in order to win.'
p4208
aS'So onto the second vote, on "Dont Eat Anything with a Face.'
p4209
aS'The team arguing for the motion: their second vote was 45 percent.'
p4210
aS'They went from 24 percent to 45 percent.'
p4211
aS'That means they picked up 21 percentage points.'
p4212
aS'That is the number to beat.'
p4213
aS"Let's see, the team against the motion, their first vote was 51 percent."
p4214
aS'Their second vote was 43 percent.'
p4215
aS'They lost 8 percentage points.'
p4216
aS'That means the team arguing for the motion, "Dont Eat Anything with a Face" is our winner.'
p4217
aS'Our congratulations to them.'
p4218
aS"And thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time."
