aS'I actually wore this t-shirt for the subject of the debate.'
p370
aS"And it's the center of the debate."
p371
aS"And it's clear."
p372
aS'The motion is science refutes God.'
p373
aS"And Michael and I have the distinct advantage here of arguing in favor of the motion because in fact we have evidence, reason, logic, rationality, and empirical methods on our side, whereas the opponents have vague hopes and fears, and they're arguing in favor of a motion that's hanging on for its existence by mere shreds of emotional and ideological spaghetti, much like this type provided by the flying spaghetti monster, one of the equally irrational gods which science provides no support for."
p374
aS"But I first want to begin by clarifying the nature of the motion, because the motion isn't science disproves God."
p375
aS"It's science Refutes God."
p376
aS"And that's very important because you can't disprove a notion that's basically vague and unfalsifiable."
p377
aS"I could not -- there's no way to disprove the notion that God didn't create all of us 15 seconds ago with the memories of the amusing comments we heard before that."
p378
aS"There's no way we can disprove that, okay."
p379
aS"And that's really important to recognize that those kind of unfalsifiable notions are unfalsifiable, as I say."
p380
aS"But we can ask, is it rational to expect that that's likely."
p381
aS'And tonight I want to emphasize that 500 years of science have demonstrated that God, that vague notion, is not likely.'
p382
aS"It's irrational to believe in God."
p383
aS'Now, to refute God means refuting several claims.'
p384
aS'Onethat are all based on faith, not evidence.'
p385
aS'One, that God is necessary, two, that there is evidence for God; and three, that that belief is rational.'
p386
aS'And the point is that the progress of science has shown over and over and over again that the answers to all those three questions are no.'
p387
aS'No, no, no.'
p388
aS'Now, my own scientific field is cosmology.'
p389
aS"And that's the study of the origin and evolution of the universe as a whole."
p390
aS"And it's where science and religion sort of confront each other."
p391
aS'And creation myths have abounded throughout human history, and science confronts those creation myths.'
p392
aS"And we'll talk about that, I'm sure, at some point in the debate."
p393
aS"But I want to point out that our opponents, I'm pretty sure, are going to argue first that one aspect of science that supports perhaps the belief in God is this notion that the universe is apparently fine-tuned for life."
p394
aS'I hear that a lot, and because it was fine-tuned so life could exist.'
p395
aS"That is a remarkable and, in fact, cosmic misunderstanding, because it's the same kind of misunderstanding that led people to believe in special creation for life on earth before Darwin."
p396
aS'It looked like everything was designed for the environment in which it lived.'
p397
aS"But what Darwin showed us was that a simple proposition, namely that there's genetic variation among a population combined with natural selection meant that you didn't need supernatural shenanigans, that in fact all the diversity of life on earth could arise from a single life form, by natural law."
p398
aS"And he didn't know -- what he showed was it was plausible, based on the evidence -- he didn't know about DNA."
p399
aS"He didn't know about the details of genetic replication, but he showed it was plausible."
p400
aS"And as I'll say, that's where we're at now as far as the understanding of the universe is concerned."
p401
aS"Now, our -- my opponents, I suspect, will argue the universe is equally fine-tuned for life, and they -- in fact, they will point out that certain fundamental parameters in nature, if they were different, we couldn't exist."
p402
aS'Or they may boldly assert that, in fact, certain of these parameters are so strange and unnatural that they must have been established with malice aforethought to ensure our existence.'
p403
aS'This too is an illusion.'
p404
aS"Just as bees need to see the color of flowers but they're not designed to do it, if they couldn't see them, they couldn't get the nectar and reproduce."
p405
aS"So what we're seeing is a version of cosmic natural selection."
p406
aS"We would be quite surprised to find ourselves living in a universe in which we couldn't live."
p407
aS'In fact, that might be evidence for God.'
p408
aS"But I want to point out that in fact the universe isn't particularly fine-tuned or conducive to life."
p409
aS'Most of the universe is rather inhospitable to life.'
p410
aS"And in fact -- perhaps the biggest fine-tuning problem in my own field of cosmology, something I'm, in fact, very proud to have proposed in a sense is that the energy of empty space is not zero."
p411
aS'The weirdest thing you can imagine, that empty space weighs something, but remarkably the energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would navely predict.'
p412
aS"And if it were much bigger than we measure, it's true that galaxies couldn't form, and planets couldn't form, and Intelligence Squared Debates couldn't happen."
p413
aS'So the universe appears to be here because Intelligence Squared is here.'
p414
aS'Now, that suggests religion perhaps, but the point is not that that claim of fine tuning is ridiculous because, in fact, if the energy of empty space was zero, which is a -- by far a more natural value, the universe would be a better place for life to live in.'
p415
aS'We all thought it was zero when I was a graduate student, because that was a natural value.'
p416
aS'If it was zero, the universe would be a better place.'
p417
aS'In fact, you can show the value that it has now makes the universe the worst of all possible universes to live in for the future of life.'
p418
aS'So, so much for a universe created for us.'
p419
aS'Now, once Darwin had removed the apparent need for God in evolution of life, the last bastion for God was the creation of the universe, how you can get something from nothing.'
p420
aS"And what -- we're in a remarkable situation of being in is precisely the same situation that Darwin existed in 150 years ago, namely, we have a plausible explanation of how a universe could precisely come from nothing."
p421
aS'If you asked, "What would be the characteristics of the universe that came from nothing by natural laws?'
p422
aS'" it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we observe, and it didn\'t have to be that way.'
p423
aS'It could have been another way.'
p424
aS"And by nothing -- and it -- the -- my opponents will say that by nothing, I'm not talking about nothing, but I'm talking about nothing, no particles, no radiation, no space, no time, and even no laws of physics."
p425
aS"Our -- my opponents might argue that the multiverse, which our universe might have spontaneously been created in, was created by physicists because they don't like God, because it's eternal and exists outside our universe, those same characteristics that God is supposed to have."
p426
aS"But it wasn't created because we don't like God, although I don't like God."
p427
aS"It was -- we'd been driven to it by measurements."
p428
aS"In fact, I don't even like the multiverse, but I've learned to force my beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality."
p429
aS"That's where science differs from religion."
p430
aS'There do remain deep philosophical and seismic questions that are unanswered, but God is not required or useful to explain any of them.'
p431
aS"And, therefore, to conclude, science has taught us that we don't need God to create a universe, that there's no evidence for God, that the specific sides of the claims of those who require God disagree with empirical evidence, and it's irrational."

p522
aS"The god I'm going todiscuss is the God of Christianity, because I'm a follower of Jesus, but my side's job is notto convince you of the truth of Christianity, although I think it is true."
p523
aS"Our job is just toshow that Christianity's God is not refuted by science."
p524
aS'Now, obviously there are somereligious beliefs that are ruled out by science, for example, the belief that the earth isstationary and orbited by the sun, moon, and stars.'
p525
aS'That is disproved by science, andperhaps prior to the 17th century, most Christians held a belief like that, as did mostother people.'
p526
aS"But that stationary earth belief is not in the least central to the Christianmessage and doctrine.To establish the motion, what our opponents have to do is to show that some centraltenet of what Christians believe about God is impossible or at least highly implausible inthe light of science, and that's a tall order."
p527
aS"Actually, they can't even come close."
p528
aS'But letme dispense with a couple of the most plausible sounding arguments.'
p529
aS'I\'ll illustrate onecommon argument from the writing of an MIT colleague, Alan Lightman, who wrote inthe Salon magazine last year, he said, "The central doctrine of science is the view thatthe laws of nature are inviolable.'
p530
aS'" He said, "Science and God are compatible as long asthe latter, God, is content to stand on the sidelines once the universe has begun.'
p531
aS'"Now, I certainly shall not shrink the God that I advocate down into a deistic, non-interventionist first cause.'
p532
aS"No, the God I'm interested in is personal and active in theworld."
p533
aS'So the question is, "How do I answer Alan Lightman?'
p534
aS'" It\'s straight forward.'
p535
aS'Thepresumption that the laws of nature are inviolable is just not a doctrine of science.'
p536
aS'Alanand a lot of other people are just wrong about that.'
p537
aS"Science's method and its programis to describe the universe insofar as it is repeatable and follows universal laws, butscience hasn't got the slightest need to extrapolate that method and program into apresumption that everything that happens must be so describable."
p538
aS'And the majority ofthe scientific heroes of history did not make that presumption.Great scientists like those that were recited before, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Faraday,Maxwell, were Christian believers who saw their science as compatible with a God whois active in the world and, on occasion, works miracles that go beyond the laws that theywere discovering.'
p539
aS'So the notion that for science to function, or in order to be asuccessful scientist, it is necessary to believe in universal laws, is indisputably disprovedby history.'
p540
aS'A second frequent critique of belief in God is that it is based on irrationalfaith rather than evidence.'
p541
aS'And this, of course, is a fallacy.'
p542
aS'Belief in God is often highlyrational.'
p543
aS'The universities that were established between, say, the 14th and the 18thcenturies, were places of explicitly religious rationality and learning.Actually, evidence is just one type of reason for belief in God, and there is a loss ofevidence for Christianity.'
p544
aS"But what the critics mean, I think, is -- they're saying there'sno scientific evidence for God."
p545
aS'And that goes to the heart of this question and the myththat science has somehow refuted God.'
p546
aS"Actually, there are some things we've learnedabout the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for thesake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God were non-existent."
p547
aS"Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support themore modest claim that there's no evidence for God?"
p548
aS'Not at all.God is mostly not a scientific question, and so the evidence for God is mostly notscientific.'
p549
aS'If you insist that scientific evidence is the only type you will count, then youput out of business not just religion, but a vast range of other human knowledge, likehistory, or the law, or politics, or philosophy, or literature.'
p550
aS"There's no scientific way toprove that Caesar crossed the Rubicon; there's no scientific way to judge the justice of averdict; there isn't even a scientific way to detect a true thought."
p551
aS'But all of these thingsare real cognitive questions whose answers are important and often indisputable.'
p552
aS'Andquestions about God are usually of the same type, not scientific.About 50 years ago, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.'
p553
aS'Soviet PresidentNikita Khrushchev told the Communist Party, anti-religionist, "Gagarin flew into spacebut he didn\'t find any God there.'
p554
aS'" Well, what a silly argument.'
p555
aS'But most of thearguments behind the view that science has refuted God are of much the same type.'
p556
aS'Ifscience, in its endeavors, fails to detect God, so what?'

aS"Actually, there are some things we've learned about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God were non-existent."
p595
aS"Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support the more modest claim that there's no evidence for God?"
p596
aS'Not at all.'
p597
aS'God is mostly not a scientific question, and so the evidence for God is mostly not scientific.'
p598
aS'If you insist that scientific evidence is the only type you will count, then you put out of business not just religion, but a vast range of other human knowledge, like history, or the law, or politics, or philosophy, or literature.'
p599
aS"There's no scientific way to prove that Caesar crossed the Rubicon; there's no scientific way to judge the justice of a verdict; there isn't even a scientific way to detect a true thought."
p600
aS'But all of these things are real cognitive questions whose answers are important and often indisputable.'
p601
aS'And questions about God are usually of the same type, not scientific.'
p602
aS'About 50 years ago, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.'
p603
aS'Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev told the Communist Party, anti-religionist, "Gagarin flew into space but he didn\'t find any God there.'
p604
aS'" Well, what a silly argument.'
p605
aS'But most of the arguments behind the view that science has refuted God are of much the same type.'
p606
aS'If science, in its endeavors, fails to detect God, so what?'
p607
aS"Thoughtful Christians don't believe that God is a natural phenomenon or a law of nature to be established by scientific investigation."
p608
aS'Science, for all of its power, is utterly incompetent to refute God.'

aS"I'm going to start off with a thought experiment."
p651
aS"Imagine you're a hominid on the plains of Africa 3.5 million years ago."
p652
aS"You're a tiny little Australopithecus afarensis, little brain."
p653
aS'Your name is Lucy.'

p657
aS'Not that Lucy, the other one.'
p658
aS'And you hear a rustle in the grass.'
p659
aS'Is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind?'
p660
aS"If you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator, and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error in cognition."
p661
aS'A false positive.'
p662
aS"You thought the wind was connected to something, and it wasn't."
p663
aS"A was connected to B, and it wasn't."
p664
aS"So that's a false positive."
p665
aS"But that's relatively harmless."
p666
aS"But if you think that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch."
p667
aS'Congratulations.'
p668
aS"You've just been given a Darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing."
p669
aS'And we are the descendants of those who are most likely to make type one errors, false-positives, versus type two errors, false-negatives.'
p670
aS"That is to say, why can't you just stay in the grass and collect enough data to get the answer right?"
p671
aS"And the answer is that predators don't wait around for prey animals to collect more data."
p672
aS"That's why they stalk and sneak up on their prey animals, so they can't get enough data."
p673
aS'So we evolve the propensity to make snap decisions and make one kind of error more likely than another kind of error.'
p674
aS"And that kind of error, that false positive, that's superstition."
p675
aS"That's magical thinking."
p676
aS"That's assuming A is connected to B."
p677
aS"It's a true pattern, and it isn't, and you're wrong."
p678
aS"That's the basis of finding false patterns like gods."
p679
aS"Now, what's the difference between the wind and a dangerous predator?"
p680
aS'The wind is an inanimate force.'
p681
aS'A dangerous predator is an intentional agent.'
p682
aS"And his intention is to eat me, and that can't be good."
p683
aS'So what we also do in addition to finding these meaningful patterns is infuse in them agency.'
p684
aS"That is, it's alive."
p685
aS"It's real, it has intention, and its intention is not good, so I better assume it's real."
p686
aS'And this is the basis of animism and spiritism and polytheism and monotheism and the belief in angels and aliens and demons and spirits and poltergeists and gods.'
p687
aS'Gods are invisible agents who run the world, who control things, who create these patterns, who are these patterns that we use to explain things.'
p688
aS'All cultures everywhere in the world have created god beliefs.'
p689
aS'Gods with these intentional -- that are intentional agents.'
p690
aS'So my question tonight is not like in my book, why do so many people believe in God, here is a theory, which I just outlined for you.'
p691
aS"But for tonight, I want to ask, what's more likely, that our opponents here happen to pick the right God and the right religion among all the -- about 10,000 different religions and about a thousand different gods the humans have constructed socially, anthropologically, psychologically in the last 10,000 years."
p692
aS'10,000 different religions, a thousand different gods.'
p693
aS'Our opponents agree with us that 999 of those gods are false gods.'
p694
aS'They are atheists like we are atheists.'
p695
aS"What I'm asking you to do is just go one God further with us."
p696
aS"So here's what happened."
p697
aS'About 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, these small bands of hunter- gathers began to coalesce into chiefdoms and states.'
p698
aS'As long as the numbers are small, informal means of behavior control and moral enforcement operate quite well.'
p699
aS"As soon as the numbers are too large for these informal means, shunning, making people feel guilty, gossiping about them, making them feel embarrassed for their bad behavior, as soon as the population are big, there's too much opportunity for free riding and for cheating the system and taking advantage of it and getting away with it."
p700
aS"So two institutions evolved, government to set up a set of rules, and everybody gets a copy; and religion in case you think you got away with it, you didn't because there's an eye in the sky that those all and sees all and keeps track of this."
p701
aS'So this is the second part of how humans construct religions and gods, because we need it for moral enforcement.'
p702
aS'It just so happens, by contingency and chance, religion and government was the first on the scene.'
p703
aS"Now, what's happened in the last several centuries, since the enlightenment, in addition to the trajectory that professor Krauss outlined for you, science displacing religion as the primary means of explaining how the world works, something else has also happened."
p704
aS"We've slowly but ineluctably replaced religion as the primary source of our morals and came up with the clever idea that you actually have to have a reason why you have certain moral principles, and we're going to write certain laws."
p705
aS'You actually have to give evidence for why you think this is a good law or a bad law or a good moral principle or a bad moral principle.'
p706
aS'And that has been the trajectory of the enlightenment since about 200 years ago.'
p707
aS"And so again, what's more likely, that one of them happens to be the one true religion, and the one true God, and all those others that have been constructed are false gods or that, as we can clearly see, anthropologically, socially, psychologically and so on, this is what people do to get along."
p708
aS'They construct religions.'
p709
aS'They construct moral systems and so on.'
p710
aS'We now know that we can do this without gods.'
p711
aS'In fact, we do it quite well without gods.'
p712
aS'Northern European countries do just fine with much lower rates of religiosity than we have.'
p713
aS"It is possible to do it, and that is what we've been doing."
p714
aS'Now, I want to finish with just one comment on the resurrection since Ian brought that up.'
p715
aS'Let me just -- leaving aside the scientific evidence for this, just think about what it is that is being said here.'
p716
aS'They are monotheists.'
p717
aS"They believe that there's just one God and that Jesus is God manifest on earth."
p718
aS'And he is your savior, and you accept him for redeeming us for sins we never committed.'
p719
aS'Somebody else in the past committed them.'
p720
aS'So as I understand this, God sacrifices himself to himself to save us from himself.'
p721
aS'If that sounds as incomprehensible to you as it does to me, I urge to you vote for our side.'

S'Thank you, Michael Shermer.'
p808
aS'And our motion is "Science Refutes God.'
p809
aS'" And now our final debater speaking against this motion, Dinesh D\'Souza.'
p810
aS'He is the best-selling of many books including, "What\'s So Great About Christianity.'
p811
aS'" He\'s also the director of the documentary "2016: Obama\'s America.'
p812
aS'" And a former policy analyst in the Reagan White House.'
p813
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, Dinesh D'Souza."
p814
aS"Dinesh D'Souza: Thank you very much."
p815
aS'How would one go about refuting the idea -- establishing the idea that science refutes God?'
p816
aS"First of all, you'd have to show that belief in God was, if not impossible, unreasonable."
p817
aS"And, therefore, you'd have to show that all the people in the world who believe in God are also being unreasonable and that science has established this not at some point in the future, but has established it already."
p818
aS'Science has refuted God right now.'
p819
aS'Now, on the face of it, this is such an odd and difficult and preposterous enterprise.'
p820
aS'Why?'
p821
aS'Because actually the questions to which God is the answer are really fundamentally not scientific questions.'
p822
aS'Here is what I mean.'
p823
aS'Here we are as human beings.'
p824
aS"We're thrown into the world."
p825
aS"And we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a universe?"
p826
aS"Second, what's our purpose?"
p827
aS'What are we doing here?'
p828
aS"Third, what's going to come after?"
p829
aS"We're going to die, but what next?"
p830
aS'Now I ask you, what are the scientific answers to those questions?'
p831
aS"And in fact, the answers are, from science, don't have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue."
p832
aS'Why?'
p833
aS'Because none of those questions is amenable to being decided empirically.'
p834
aS'Science can show how we got a universe but not why.'
p835
aS'On the question of what our purpose is here, science is completely silent.'
p836
aS'Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science.'
p837
aS'Why?'
p838
aS'Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be.'
p839
aS'And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical evidence can science provide on either side of that question?'
p840
aS'So because science is in no position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology.'
p841
aS"And we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years."
p842
aS"It's an effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation."
p843
aS'You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could be dismissed as wishful thinking, "We wish for a better world and so we make one up.'
p844
aS'" Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really wouldn\'t explain why major religions have invented Hell.'
p845
aS'Who would wish for that?'
p846
aS'Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life.'
p847
aS'And then you\'ve heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, "Well, belief in God depends on where you\'re born.'
p848
aS"If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be a Muslim."
p849
aS"If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian."
p850
aS'" Michael Shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods.'
p851
aS'But the sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief.'
p852
aS"I'm sure that people who are born in Oxford, England, are most likely to believe in Darwin's theory of evolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi."
p853
aS"I'm sure people who are born in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in New Guinea."
p854
aS'What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true?'
p855
aS'Nothing.'
p856
aS'The genesis of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be sustained as a matter of argument.'
p857
aS'The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about Darwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 -- in the 1850s, science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite direction.'
p858
aS'And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way.'
p859
aS'When the discovery of the big bang came -- this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science -- so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning.'
p860
aS'Why?'
p861
aS"Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning."
p862
aS'In other words, this was something that the ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a single scientific experiment.'
p863
aS'By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies.'
p864
aS'Other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, "No, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe.'
p865
aS'" By the way, that\'s almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, "First, there was nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completely consistent to what -- with what Christians believe, and exactly said by the ancient Hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the basis of, "God told us.'
p866
aS'" And the astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'
p867
aS'Now, the fine-tuned universe is -- has become now a tremendous embarrassment to atheism.'
p868
aS'Why?'
p869
aS'Because ultimately it shows that the laws and constants of nature are fine-tuned, not only for the existence of life, but specifically for human life.'
p870
aS'I want to note that this is an argument completely immune to Darwinian attack.'
p871
aS'This is not about whether the horse, the dog, and the wolf had a common ancestor.'
p872
aS"Let's remember that evolution, powerful theory as it is, is not a theory of life."
p873

p883
aS'Now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you in the audience and from me.'
p884
aS"We have two teams of two, they're arguing out this motion: science refutes God."
p885
aS"Lawrence Krauss and Michael Shermer are arguing for the motion, and they are basically making the argument -- number one, they're saying they are not arguing that science disproves God, but that science makes the possibility of the existence very, very unlikely."
p886
aS"They point out, their argument, that the universe is so badly designed, actually, for human life, that it's highly unlikely that anybody would've thought this up."
p887
aS'They also say that God is a human creation, that this is established in history, psychology, anthropology, and that in the past God was the answer to a question that science has now answered more and more successfully.'
p888
aS"The team arguing against the motion, Dinesh D'Souza and Ian Hutchinson, are making the argument that belief in God, number one, is very rational; number two, that there is evidence for the existence of God, it's just not evidence that one would call scientific."
p889
aS'That, in fact, science is not capable of answering the kinds of questions that God answers, such as, "Why are we here?'
p890
aS'" The "why?'
p891
aS'" questions, where do we go afterwards?'
p892
aS'They also say that the arguments being made on the -- by the other side, that are based on social sciences like anthropology and psychology, are pop science; and therefore, I believe, to be disqualified.'
p893
aS"So we're going to take questions from you and from me, but I want to start by actually getting to something I'm very curious about, and that's the issue of miracles."
p894
aS'I want to put to this side, you in particular, Ian Hutchinson, who is arguing against the notion that science refutes God, what is a miracle if not a violation of the laws of physics?'
p895
aS'And is that what it is, in addition to all of its other implications?'
p896
aS'Does it not violate the laws of physics?'
p897

p914
aS'He is the best-selling ofmany books including, "What\'s So Great About Christianity.'
p915
aS'" He\'s also the director ofthe documentary "2016: Obama\'s America.'
p916
aS'" And a former policy analyst in the ReaganWhite House.'
p917
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, Dinesh D'Souza.Dinesh D'Souza: [[applause]] Thank you very much."
p918
aS'How would one go about refuting the idea -- establishing theidea that science refutes God?'
p919
aS"First of all, you'd have to show that belief in God was, ifnot impossible, unreasonable."
p920
aS"And, therefore, you'd have to show that all the people inthe world who believe in God are also being unreasonable and that science hasestablished this not at some point in the future, but has established it already."
p921
aS'Sciencehas refuted God right now.'
p922
aS'Now, on the face of it, this is such an odd and difficult andpreposterous enterprise.'
p923
aS'Why?'
p924
aS'Because actually the questions to which God is theanswer are really fundamentally not scientific questions.Here is what I mean.'
p925
aS'Here we are as human beings.'
p926
aS"We're thrown into the world."
p927
aS"Andwe can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there auniverse?"
p928
aS"Second, what's our purpose?"
p929
aS'What are we doing here?'
p930
aS"Third, what's goingto come after?"
p931
aS"We're going to die, but what next?"
p932
aS'Now I ask you, what are thescientific answers to those questions?'
p933
aS"And in fact, the answers are, from science, don'thave a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue."
p934
aS'Why?'
p935
aS'Because none of thosequestions is amenable to being decided empirically.'
p936
aS'Science can show how we got auniverse but not why.'
p937
aS'On the question of what our purpose is here, science iscompletely silent.'
p938
aS'Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science.'
p939
aS'Why?'
p940
aS'Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be.And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empiricalevidence can science provide on either side of that question?'
p941
aS'So because science is inno position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology.'
p942
aS"Andwe've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years."
p943
aS"It's aneffort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation."
p944
aS'You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could bedismissed as wishful thinking, "We wish for a better world and so we make one up.'
p945
aS'"Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it reallywouldn\'t explain why major religions have invented Hell.'
p946
aS'Who would wish for that?Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life.And then you\'ve heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, "Well, belief in Goddepends on where you\'re born.'
p947
aS"If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be aMuslim."
p948
aS"If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian."
p949
aS'" MichaelShermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods.'
p950
aS'But thesociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief.'
p951
aS"I'm sure thatpeople who are born in Oxford, England, are most likely to believe in Darwin's theory ofevolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi."
p952
aS"I'm sure people who areborn in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born inNew Guinea.What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true?"
p953
aS'Nothing.'
p954
aS'The genesisof a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can besustained as a matter of argument.'
p955
aS'The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot aboutDarwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 -- in the 1850s,science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the oppositedirection.And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicateddefensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way.'
p956
aS'When thediscovery of the big bang came -- this, by the way, was at a time when most scientistsbelieved the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrineof American and Western science -- so it came as a shock that the universe had abeginning.'
p957
aS'Why?'
p958
aS"Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, butspace and time also had a beginning."
p959
aS'In other words, this was something that theancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a singlescientific experiment.'
p960
aS'By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies.'
p961
aS'Otherancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter godwho made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, "No, first therewas nothing, and then there was a universe.'
p962
aS'"By the way, that\'s almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, "First, there wasnothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completelyconsistent to what -- with what Christians believe, and exactly said by the ancientHebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on thebasis of, "God told us.'
p963
aS'" And the astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modernscience, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only tofind a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.Now, the fine-tuned universe is -- has become now a tremendous embarrassment to [[applause]] atheism.'
p964
aS'Why?'
p965
aS'Because ultimately it shows that the laws and constants of nature arefine-tuned, not only for the existence of life, but specifically for human life.I want to note that this is an argument completely immune to Darwinian attack.'
p966
aS'This isnot about whether the horse, the dog, and the wolf had a common ancestor.'
p967
aS"Let'sremember that evolution, powerful theory as it is, is not a theory of life."
p968
aS'It is only atheory of transitions between life forms.'
p969
aS"It's not about the origin of life, it's simplyabout how life form A gave rise to life form B."
