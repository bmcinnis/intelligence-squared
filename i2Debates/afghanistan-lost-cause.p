p30
aS'And even if itcould be done, it shouldnt be done.'
p31
aS'It cannot be done, because the Karzai government ishopelessly corrupt, inept and unpopular.'
p32
aS'Because Afghanistan is a tribal culture that hasnever accepted strong centralized authority.'
p33
aS'Because after 9 years of combat there hasbeen essentially zero progress in handing responsibility for security to the Afghanis.And it shouldnt be done because we have falsely conflated the Taliban with Al Qaeda.The Taliban is local: it wants to impose its extreme version of Islam on the territory it isfighting to control in Afghanistan.'
p34
aS'In contrast, Al Qaeda is global.'
p35
aS'It is largely based inPakistan, with outposts in Yemen and Somalia and is specifically organized to projectterror globally and is a clear threat to US national interests.'
p36
aS'Prevailing in Afghanistanwill not diminish Al Qaeda.The counter argument is that it should be done because the Taliban and Al Qaeda areideological soul mates.'
p37
aS'The Taliban sponsored Al Qaeda before and will do it again.'
p38
aS'Thesuccess of their insurgency will be a humanitarian disaster, a stinging defeat for the USand our allies, and will provide no end of encouragement to our enemies.'
p39
aS'And it can bedone because our efforts in Afghanistan to defeat that insurgency are now headed byGeneral Petraeus.'
p40
aS'He accomplished a much harder mission in Iraq where he literallywrote the book on counter insurgency operations.He is among the most creative and thoughtful military leaders we have, or have ever had.We are succeeding in making life miserable indeed for the Taliban, thus setting up theconditions for a negotiated settlement.'
p41
aS'We have been at this, with full troop deploymentand under Petraeus leadership for a few months.'

aS"But I just want to say also, too, if there're any Marines in the room, happy birthday Marines."
p180
aS'Today is the 235th birthday of the Marine Corps.'
p181
aS"And it's appropriate to be having this discussion tonight because, you know, so far this year in Afghanistan, or so far this month in Afghanistan, the first ten days in November, we've seen 16 service members killed, many of them marines."
p182
aS"So it's important for us to have a discussion on a day like this because it's those service members and their families who are bearing the direct costs of this conflict."
p183
aS"You're going to hear tonight a lot of nuanced and complex arguments between us."
p184
aS"And that's about right because the United States is entangled in a very complicated situation."
p185
aS'To use the term civil war is not incorrect.'
p186
aS"You're going to hear us disagree on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda."
p187
aS'I found, in my experience, in both eastern and southern Afghanistan, that the vast, vast majority of the Taliban that are fighting our troops every day are not wedded to an ideology that al-Qaeda embraces, that they are fighting occupation, and they are not fighting for some type of transnational jihad.'
p188
aS'You will see us disagree over the similarities between the Iraq and Afghan surge.'
p189
aS'Again, I was in both.'
p190
aS'I was fully invested in the Iraq surge in 2006 in Anbar province, I was one of the first civilian surge members last year into Afghanistan.'
p191
aS'And there are similarities between the Iraq surge and the Afghan surge.'
p192
aS"But those similarities are more in terms of how the US is doing policy and how we didn't do things right to begin with in Iraq and now all those policies we're doing wrong in Afghanistan."
p193
aS'And I look forward to a discussion.'
p194
aS"I know Nir's got a lot of comments on this, and I look forward to having this talk with Peter and Max."
p195
aS"You're also going to hear a lot of facts, figures and statistics tonight."
p196
aS'And I want you to keep in mind the big picture.'
p197
aS'I want you to ask, so what?'
p198
aS'After every fact or figure or statistic you hear.'
p199
aS"Hopefully when Peter and Max say it and not when Nir and I say it, because it's just a case of don't lose sight or track of the forest because of the trees."
p200
aS'And so keep in mind, bear in mind some basic aspects of the war in Afghanistan.'
p201
aS'The cost.'
p202
aS'Last year we spent -- the United States spent $104 billion in Afghanistan.'
p203
aS'This year, we are projected to spend $119 billion in Afghanistan.'
p204
aS"Afghanistan's GDP is $14 billion."
p205
aS"We are spending seven times as much in that country as it's worth."
p206
aS'As the Dutch, the Canadian, probably the French and Italians move out of Afghanistan, of course, our costs will go up.'
p207
aS"And so when you hear the administration say, we're looking at keeping this policy in place till 2014, that's a half trillion price tag plus about 2400 dead American and coalition soldiers as well as thousands more Afghans at this pace."
p208
aS'Keep in mind that since 2005, we have seen a fivefold increase in U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan.'
p209
aS'Literally every year since 2005, we have doubled the foreign troop presence in Afghanistan.'
p210
aS"And what's occurred from that is that only every year a commensurate rise in violence, a commensurate rise in support for the Taliban and a decrease in support for the Karzai government."
p211
aS'You see this with a number of Taliban.'
p212
aS'In 2005, we estimated there are 2000 active duty fighters in Afghanistan.'
p213
aS"Now we're estimating there are 35 to 40,000 active duty Taliban fighters in Afghanistan."
p214
aS"So not only is the policy expensive, failing, it's also counterproductive because it's causing people to join the insurgency."
p215
aS"It's exasperating the conflict, and it's making the region less stable."
p216
aS'And that includes Pakistan.'
p217
aS'Additionally, keep in mind the nature of al-Qaeda.'
p218
aS'Keep in mind it is only 50 to a hundred members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, according to our CIA.'
p219
aS'And contrast that with the 1,000 -- the 2,000 members of al-Qaeda that our State Department said are still in Iraq in their report last August on terrorism.'
p220
aS'Contrast that with the fact that the German police say there are 45 members of al-Qaeda in Hamburg, Germany.'
p221
aS'Hamburg being the place that probably had as much to do with the planning, if not more, for the 9/11 attacks than Afghanistan.'
p222
aS'And before I forget to put a plug in for a great article on the nature of al-Qaeda on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and on 9/11, please read the New Yorker article from September by Terry McDermott.'
p223
aS'Really shows how al-Qaeda is this grouping of individuals.'
p224
aS"It's a collection of individuals."
p225
aS"It's not a formal military organization that we can defeat with conventional forces."
p226
aS'And think about it.'
p227
aS'Look back at the last 10 years of their attacks.'
p228
aS'Their most recent attack, a lady who took two parcel bombs and FedExed them from Yemen.'
p229
aS"Look at the attacks of the last three years in this country in the sense that they're done by individuals, small cells, it's a decentralized organization that will not be affected by the presence of brigade combat teams occupying Southern Afghanistan."
p230
aS'So nine years ago 19 men hijacked four airplanes.'
p231
aS"We're now in Afghanistan 109 months later with 100,000 troops spending over $100 billion a year."
p232
aS'Nir and I are not advocating for us to cut and run or abandon Afghanistan but we are advocating for a policy that is not destabilizing, not counterproductive, and not effective against Afghanistan.'
p233
aS"We're arguing for something that will -- or against al-Qaeda, we're actually arguing for something that will affect al-Qaeda and stabilize the region."

aS"I know they will make a valiant attempt as you've already heard Matt do, but I'm very sorry to say they have an impossible burden of proof today."
p358
aS"They have to convince you that it's impossible for America and our allies to prevail in Afghanistan, that there is no way we can achieve our objective, which isn't to create paradise on earth, but merely an Afghanistan that is free of terrorist safe havens and that can secure and govern itself."
p359
aS"For our part, we don't have to convince you that success is assured; only that it's possible."
p360
aS'For anyone familiar with military history, that ought to be a no-brainer.'

p362
aS'Think of Britain standing alone against the Nazis in 1940.'
p363

aS"Now, you will hear, as you've already heard from Matt, our opponents say that Afghanistan isn't Iraq."
p365
aS"And they're right."
p366
aS'Iraq was much worse.'
p367
aS'In 2006 Iraq was in the throes of a full-blown civil war.'
p368
aS'That year 34,000 civilians died, Shia and Sunni terrorists had high levels of support in their sectarian communities, Prime Minister Malikis government was implicated in death squad activity, and back home the Democrats won majorities in Congress on an antiwar platform.'
p369
aS'Even many supporters of the war effort thought we were on the brink of defeat.'
p370
aS'For example, on August 9th of 2006, I wrote in the L.A. Times, "Bush needs to do something radical to shake up a deteriorating status quo if we are to have any hope of averting the worst American military defeat since Vietnam.'
p371
aS'Luckily President Bush did do something radical.'
p372
aS'He ordered a surge which turned around a war effort which many had written off as hopeless.'
p373
aS'Today another surge is just starting, and it actually has better prospects of success because the situation in Afghanistan is objectively much better than it was in Iraq.'
p374
aS"Yes, civilian casualties are up, but they're still 1/16th as high as they were in Iraq."
p375
aS'Yes, violence has spread, but 63 percent of attacks still happen in just three provinces.'
p376
aS'Yes, there is the stress among ethnic groups.'
p377
aS'We are not facing a civil war.'
p378
aS'This is an intra-Pashtun conflict.'
p379
aS'Yes, Hamid Karzai is a problematic leader, but at least he is not running death squads and he has cooperated on important initiatives such as the village security program.'
p380
aS'And, yes, public opinion has turned against the war, but President Obama will receive a lot more support from Republicans than President Bush received from Democrats.'
p381
aS'I am also relatively optimistic about Afghanistan because the armed forces have gotten much better at counterinsurgency.'
p382
aS'The COIN strategy that General Petraeus is implementing today draws not only on the war in Iraq, but also in conflicts as diverse as Columbia, El Salvador, Malaya, and the Philippines.'
p383
aS'He is not only focusing on kinetic operations, killing the enemy, but also on improving governance, intelligence collection, the handling of detainees, information operations and much more.'
p384
aS'Its a huge difference from the sleepy days of 2008 when there were only 32,000 U.S. troops in the country and they were stuck in a holding pattern.'
p385
aS'Now we have a hundred thousands troops there.'
p386
aS'The last of the surge forces only arrived in September but already theyre making a difference.'
p387
aS'This summer I visited Nawa in Helmand province.'
p388
aS'Before the Marines got there in 2009, it was a virtual ghost town dominated by the Taliban.'

aS'Stores and schools have reopened, electrical lines are going up.'
p391
aS'Agricultural canals are being cleared.'
p392
aS'This is tangible progress.'
p393
aS'Similar operations are now in full-swing around Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban.'
p394
aS'The New York Times, hardly a pro-war organ, reported on October 20, American and Afghan forces have been routing the Taliban in much of Kandahar Province in recent weeks forcing many hardened fighters to flee strongholds they have held for years.'
p395
aS'We are also seeing stepped-up operations to capture or kill Taliban and Haqqani leaders.'
p396
aS'In the past 90 days, Special Operations forces have carried out more than 1,500 operations resulting in the death or capture of almost 3,800 insurgents.'
p397
aS'Air strikes have more than doubled over the past year and yet according to the U.N., civilian deaths from NATO bombings were down 64 percent in the first half of the year.'
p398
aS'Thats a tribute to the very careful rules of engagement promulgated by General McChrystal and General Petraeus something that distinguishes us greatly from the way the Red Army or others have fought in Afghanistan.'
p399
aS'To win over the population, coalition forces are also working to improve governance and cut corruption.'
p400
aS'A lot of the corruption in Afghanistan has been fueled by our own money.'
p401
aS'In the years when we have few troops there, we contracted out security to warlords who abused the people and drove them into the arms of the Taliban.'
p402
aS'Now that is changing.'
p403
aS'We are less reliant on warlords and General Petraeus is striving to ensure that our spending doesnt fuel corruption.'
p404
aS'A lot of the focus today is on avoiding bottlenecks in Kabul by working in the provinces where the troops are assisted by a civilian surge with the number of civilian U.S. government employees there having gone up three times in the past year, three fold.'
p405
aS'Perhaps the most important line of operations is the training of Afghan security forces, the ANSF.'
p406
aS'Thats our ticket out of Afghanistan.'
p407
aS'As they stand up, we can draw down responsibly as weve done in Iraq.'
p408
aS'We dont need to stay until Afghanistan is as peaceful as Switzerland, only until it can be secured by its own troops.'
p409
aS'And how is the ANSF training going?'
p410
aS'Well let me quote you again from The New York Times on October 12.'
p411
aS'Which said that Long a lagging priority, the plan to produce many more trained Afghan troops is moving this fall at a rapid pace.'
p412
aS'ANSF numbers have jumped from 137,000 in 2008 to 258,000 today and their quality is higher because of smaller class sizes and more intensive mentoring.'
p413
aS'Salaries are up, desertion rates are down.'
p414
aS'Now I dont want to over-estimate the progress that has occurred or under-estimate the problems that remain.'
p415
aS'There is no doubt that we face a long, hard fight.'
p416
aS'But the biggest thing we have on our side is public opinion.'
p417
aS'My colleague Peter Bergen will tell you more about this.'
p418
aS'But the fact is the Afghans have experienced Taliban rule and they didnt like it.'
p419
aS'Fewer than 10 percent say they want a return to the Taliban.'
p420
aS'More than 60 percent support the NATO troop presence.'
p421
aS'Again, John, this is not the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.'
p422
aS'We have the people on our side.'
p423
aS'Is Afghanistan a lost cause?'

p425
aS'Otherwise he wouldnt have sent more than 50,000 additional troops there.'

aS'Otherwise he wouldnt have accepted a command that could tarnish his sterling legacy.'

p562
aS'Now, people like toforget about Iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it.'
p563
aS"But I think we can'tunderstand what's happening in Afghanistan and what the Americans think they're doingin Afghanistan without understanding what really happened in Iraq."
p564
aS'The surge is thisnarrative that things were going badly.You have the 2006 Samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil warbroke out.'
p565
aS'And then this genius general called David Petraeus came up with a new wayof fighting a war, and that solved the problem.'
p566

p569
aS'He signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of otherpeople involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes.'
p570
aS"But youhave all kind of academics and officers involved in that process.Now, the civil war in Iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the American forces.It was Black and Decker."
p571
aS'What do I mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in Iraqthat was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a Sunni militiaman.'
p572
aS'If you find the corpsewith Black and Decker power drill marks in it, Shia militiamen killed it.'
p573
aS'And whatdefeated the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was not the American surge.'
p574
aS'It was Shiamilitiamen in collaboration with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army who brutally crushedthe Sunni population,Not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of theAmericans.There was a Shia colonel in west Baghdad called Sabah , an armycriminal who used to kidnap men, Sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex withthem in order to release these men.'
p575
aS'Beginning in 2006, this was about six months beforePetraeus came into Iraq, I began to meet Iraqi resistance leaders in Baghdad, in Syria, inJordan.'
p576
aS'And suddenly, they were saying, We lost, we lost.'
p577
aS'And why did they lose?Because the Shia had depopulated Sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that theAmericans could never use.'
p578
aS'So we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates.At the same time, you had a total separation of Sunni and Shia civilians thanks to the civilwar.'
p579
aS'One side won the civil war, the Shias, one side lost, the Sunnis.'
p580
aS'And Sunnineighborhoods in Baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns.'
p581
aS'This is all sixmonths before the surge started.'

aS'Al-Qaeda guys would come in there and total the village, blow up all the houses, slaughter the men, likewise Shiamilitiamen were doing the same thing to Sunni villages.Seven months after the surge, violence was still peaking.'
p584
aS'What changed, apart from theSunni realization that they lost was the Shia cease fire.'
p585
aS'The Shia militiamen, the Mahdiarmy declared a ceasefire, and violence dropped significantly after that.'
p586
aS'At the sametime, you had a government that actually had some legitimacy because they would, a yearlater, go after the Shia militiamen, totally destroying them as well.Now, none of the factors that helped reduce violence in Iraq to the terrible levels wherethey are today, still worse than Afghanistan, none of these factors even exist inAfghanistan.'
p587
aS'First of all, the Sunnis in Iraq who dominated the insurgency, were 20percent of the population.'
p588
aS'And they were destroyed and brutalized and turned intorefugees in Syria and Jordan and elsewhere.'
p589
aS'The insurgency is Afghanistan is dominatedby Pashtuns, 38 to 40 percent of the population, the largest group in Afghanistan.And they are not being brutalized.'
p590
aS"The Taliban is not a Pashtun movement, but it'sdominated by Pashtuns."
p591

p592
aS'They have themomentum.'
p593
aS'They are spreading not only in Pashtun areas, but even in the north, amongnon-Pastuns, among Tajiks and Turkmen and Uzbeks, theyre reactivating old networksfrom the Taliban era.'
p594
aS'They feel like theyre doing quite well.'
p595
aS'Likewise, Baghdad wasthe prize in the civil war in Iraq.'
p596
aS'It was the dense, urban areas.'
p597
aS'The Americans couldtake each neighborhood in Baghdad and build immense walls around them, and reallycontrol the population.'
p598
aS'In Afghanistan its a rural insurgency.'
p599
aS'We might be focusing onthe cities Kandahar, Kabul, Lashkar Gah--the Russians did the same thing.'
p600
aS'Most of thepopulation of Afghanistan is in the villages.'
p601
aS"The Taliban are in the villages, just like theMujahideen in the '80s were in the villages."
p602
aS"We're making the same mistakes that theRussians were making, trying to control the cities and thinking that somehow we'll defeatthe Mujahideen and the Taliban who are in the rural areas.Now, in Iraq, we had a government that somehow had some legitimacy."
p603
aS'Theyrepresented the majority of the people.'
p604
aS'They crushed the Shia militias.'
p605
aS'In Afghanistan --a key element in American counterinsurgency thinking is that you have to build thecapacity of the government so it can spread its power and control the population.'
p606
aS'But inAfghanistan, the government is the problem.'
p607
aS"It's predatory, it's corrupt."
p608
aS"It's lacking anycredibility."
p609
aS'Its the best recruiter for the Taliban.'
p610
aS'So the last thing we want to do is allyourselves and tie ourselves to this Afghan government which is hated by most of thepopulation.'
p611
aS"The police, when they're not doing drugs, the Afghan police are stealing fromstores, are demanding taxes at checkpoints."
p612
aS'The Afghan army, I was with the Americansin the surge of 2009.'
p613
aS"The Afghan army didn't show up."
p614
aS"They're Afghanpolice."
p615
aS"This time in Kandahar, the Afghan army didn't show up again."
p616
aS"We've spentbillions on the Afghan army."
p617
aS'We, as taxpayers should be upset about this.'
p618
aS"And who'sfighting on our side in Kandahar today?"
p619
aS"It's not the Afghan army."
p620
aS"It is Colonel Raziqfrom the border police, a brutal warlord who brutalized the population of Kandahar a fewyears ago and turned many people, such as the Noorzai clan, against the U.S. and joinedthe Taliban.We've gone back to the same guy, Colonel Raziq, not the army, recruited a warlord.Where is the Afghan army?"
p621
aS'They just decided not to show up.'
p622
aS"We don't know whathappened to our billions of dollars."
p623
aS"So you don't have a government with any legitimacyor any prospect of legitimacy."
p624
aS"You don't have any sign that you're defeating theinsurgency or that you're punishing the population."
p625
aS"In fact, there's only onecounterinsurgency campaign that's ever worked in history."
p626
aS'That was the British inMalaya.'
p627
aS'And why did that work?'
p628
aS'The British basically took half a million ethnicChinese, put them in concentration camps and took them away from their homes.'
p629
aS'So,sure, we can do that in Afghanistan.'
p630
aS'We could defeat the Taliban.'
p631
aS'We could massivelydepopulate Pashtun areas and be genocidal about it.'
p632
aS"Short of that, there's just no evidenceto date that we can do anything better."
p633
aS'Nine years into this, every year, things havegotten worse and worse.'
p634
aS'This year is the worst year so far.'
p635
aS'Next year is guaranteed to beworse.'
p636
aS'The violence is spreading.'
p637
aS'Taliban control about 80 percent of the country rightnow.We are hated.'
p638
aS'In my travels, I was shocked -- I was in Afghanistan last January andFebruary.'
p639
aS'And I was shocked to see that school teachers, local government officials, busdrivers were all complaining to me about the Americans and their night raids and theiroperations killing civilians.'

p655
aS'You have more civilians being killed in Iraq today than you do in Afghanistan today.'
p656
aS'This is after the surge.'
p657
aS'Now, people like to forget about Iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it.'
p658
aS"But I think we can't understand what's happening in Afghanistan and what the Americans think they're doing in Afghanistan without understanding what really happened in Iraq."
p659
aS'The surge is this narrative that things were going badly.'
p660
aS'You have the 2006 Samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil war broke out.'
p661
aS'And then this genius general called David Petraeus came up with a new way of fighting a war, and that solved the problem.'
p662
aS'None of that is really true.'
p663

p664

p665
aS'He signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of other people involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes.'
p666
aS'But you have all kind of academics and officers involved in that process.'
p667
aS"Now, the civil war in Iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the American forces."
p668
aS'It was Black and Decker.'
p669
aS'What do I mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in Iraq that was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a Sunni militiaman.'
p670
aS'If you find the corpse with Black and Decker power drill marks in it, Shia militiamen killed it.'
p671
aS'And what defeated the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was not the American surge.'
p672
aS'It was Shia militiamen in collaboration with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army who brutally crushed the Sunni population, Not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of the Americans.'
p673
aS'There was a Shia colonel in west Baghdad called Sabah , an army criminal who used to kidnap men, Sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex with them in order to release these men.'
p674
aS'Beginning in 2006, this was about six months before Petraeus came into Iraq, I began to meet Iraqi resistance leaders in Baghdad, in Syria, in Jordan.'
p675
aS'And suddenly, they were saying, We lost, we lost.'
p676
aS'And why did they lose?'
p677
aS'Because the Shia had depopulated Sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that the Americans could never use.'
p678
aS'So we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates.'
p679
aS'At the same time, you had a total separation of Sunni and Shia civilians thanks to the civil war.'
p680
aS'One side won the civil war, the Shias, one side lost, the Sunnis.'
p681
aS'And Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns.'
p682
aS'This is all six months before the surge started.'

p814
aS"It's very good to be on this stage with them and my colleague Max."
p815
aS"And let's remind -- Max at the beginning said what this motion was about."
p816
aS'This motion is not about Afghanistan is kind of not going well.'
p817
aS"This motion is not about we're kind of not doing so well."
p818
aS"We're sort of losing."
p819
aS'This is -- the motion is about Afghanistan is a lost cause.'
p820
aS'Now, that is a pretty high bar that they have to prove.'
p821
aS"And so far we've heard a lot about Iraq, not much about Afghanistan, and some pretty easy to disprove assertions that they've made when they talked about Afghanistan."
p822
aS"And some things that they didn't even talk about, I'm surprised."
p823
aS'You know, the graveyard of empires cliche, for instance.'
p824
aS"They didn't bring this up."
p825
aS'Well, turns out that many empires have gone into Afghanistan and done pretty well.'
p826
aS"The only empire that didn't do well there was the Soviets for the very good reason that they, as my colleague Max point out, they killed a million Afghans, made 5 million of them homeless."
p827
aS"A successful counterinsurgency operation is exactly what we're doing and what the Soviets did not do."
p828
aS'Rather, the small numbers of Afghan civilians are dying in this war, too many to be sure.'
p829
aS"But we're talking, instead of millions, as happened under the Soviets, hundreds."
p830
aS'And as Max pointed out, the numbers are dropping, particularly because of our rules of engagement.'
p831
aS'We heard from Nir that Afghanistan is a very violent place.'
p832
aS"Well, actually, you're more likely to be murdered in my hometown of Washington, D.C. than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now."
p833
aS'Last year, about 3,000 Afghan civilians were killed in the war, population of 30 million.'
p834
aS"But you're more likely to be murdered in the United States in 1991 just generally than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now."
p835
aS'It is simply not that violent.'
p836
aS'In fact, my wife is sitting here.'
p837
aS'We met in Afghanistan.'
p838
aS'You can actually have quite a good time in Kabul.'
p839
aS"It's a relatively peaceful place."
p840
aS'There are restaurants, there are bars.'
p841
aS'You can have a regular social life, which, by the way, you could never have in Baghdad.'
p842
aS"And if you look at the murder rates in countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, and Russia, they're much, much higher than the death rate from the war in Afghanistan."
p843
aS"We're not saying that Washington, D.C. is a lost cause."
p844
aS'Maybe some people might say that.'
p845
aS"But we're not saying that Russia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Columbia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Mexico is a lost cause, we're not saying Venezuela is a lost cause, yet our opponents are suggesting it's a lost cause."
p846
aS'And this is ridiculous.'
p847
aS"Another thing we've heard, of course, if the Karzai government is corrupt, and inefficient, and incompetent, sure, no doubt, but let's look at the neighborhood."
p848
aS"To his west he has Iran with Ahmadinejad, who's a Holocaust denier."
p849
aS"We don't need to say much more about him."
p850
aS'To his north he has Karimov, of Uzbekistan, who boils people alive as a sort of forensic technique.'
p851
aS"To his west we have the military dictatorship on and off of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, the President, who's Mr. 10 percent because he takes at least 10 percent of everything."
p852
aS"And so if you look at the neighborhood he's in, this is -- Karzai is looking pretty good."
p853
aS'And he actually won at the most recent election.'
p854
aS"Sure, it wasn't the fairest election in history."
p855
aS"But he's winning elections."
p856
aS'I mean, this is a democracy.'
p857
aS'Look at the neighborhood.'
p858
aS'And, in fact, Freedom House, which looks at political freedoms around the world, judges that Afghanistan is about as free as any of the immediate neighbors.'
p859
aS"And look at Afghan history, think about Karzai's predecessor for a second, the warlords, the Taliban, Najibullah, the Communist dictator, and, of course, the Soviets."
p860
aS'By that standard, both regionally and historically, Karzai is looking pretty good.'
p861
aS"One of the weakest arguments that our opponents didn't even bring up is that foreign forces in Afghanistan are always antibodies."
p862
aS"Well, Nir did say that we're hated."
p863
aS'BBC, hardly pro-American, generally speaking, news organization, found that 68 percent of Afghans last year had a favorable view of the U.S. military.'
p864
aS"Well, you probably can't find 68 percent of the inhabitants of the upper west side who have a favorable view of the U.S. military."
p865
aS'And yet the Afghans do, and that number used to be 85 percent.'
p866
aS"Sure, we're losing some of our popularity, but we are still liked."
p867
aS"They don't want us to go."
p868
aS'They want us to perform on the promises that we seem to have given them early on that we would bring a more relatively prosperous and stable place.'
p869
aS'And since at the heart of a counterinsurgency is the views of the population, the population is very much on our side.'
p870
aS"Matthew mentioned that we can't afford this war."
p871
aS"Well, we're spending $100 billion on the war."
p872
aS"That's one percent of GDP."
p873
aS'Between Vietnam we spent 10 percent of our GDP on the war.'
p874
aS"And I think this money's well-spent."
p875
aS'First off, the numbers are going to go down as we spend less money and we have fewer troops.'
p876
aS'Secondly, just -- we were sitting in New York, and my wife and I just toured the Trade Center site this morning, and, you know, that cost 3,000 American lives, and it cost $500 billion, and it affects the American economy, five percent of our GDP, had a devastating effect on so many of us in this room.'
p877
aS'And, you know, to make sure that al-Qaeda cannot come back to Afghanistan is money very, very well-spent, and the idea that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are not somehow allied is ridiculous.'
p878
aS"Anybody in this room who recalls the May, 2010, attempt in Times Square by a guy called Faisal Shahzad to blow up an SUV to kill dozens of people on a Saturday night at 6:00, luckily it didn't work out, well, he came from the Pakistani Taliban, which is a group that has been infected ideologically by al-Qaeda."
p879
aS'And the fact that al-Qaeda is a relatively small group doesnt mean very much at all because on 9/11 al-Qaeda only consisted of 200 people.'
p880

p908
aS"And Iwant to salute Nir Rosen's brave and enterprising reporting."
p909
aS"It's very good to be on thisstage with them and my colleague Max."
p910
aS"And let's remind -- Max at the beginning saidwhat this motion was about."
p911
aS'This motion is not about Afghanistan is kind of not goingwell.'
p912
aS"This motion is not about we're kind of not doing so well."
p913
aS"We're sort of losing.This is -- the motion is about Afghanistan is a lost cause."
p914
aS'Now, that is a pretty high barthat they have to prove.'
p915
aS"And so far we've heard a lot about Iraq, not much aboutAfghanistan, and some pretty easy to disprove assertions that they've made when theytalked about Afghanistan."
p916
aS"And some things that they didn't even talk about, I'msurprised."
p917
aS'You know, the graveyard of empires cliche, for instance.'
p918
aS"They didn't bringthis up."
p919
aS"Well, turns out that many empires have gone into Afghanistan and done prettywell.The only empire that didn't do well there was the Soviets for the very good reason thatthey, as my colleague Max point out, they killed a million Afghans, made 5 million ofthem homeless."
p920
aS"A successful counterinsurgency operation is exactly what we're doingand what the Soviets did not do."
p921
aS'Rather, the small numbers of Afghan civilians are dyingin this war, too many to be sure.'
p922
aS"But we're talking, instead of millions, as happenedunder the Soviets, hundreds."
p923
aS'And as Max pointed out, the numbers are dropping,particularly because of our rules of engagement.We heard from Nir that Afghanistan is a very violent place.'
p924
aS"Well, actually, you're morelikely to be murdered in my hometown of Washington, D.C. than you are to be killed inthe war in Afghanistan right now."
p925
aS'Last year, about 3,000 Afghan civilians were killed inthe war, population of 30 million.'
p926
aS"But you're more likely to be murdered in the UnitedStates in 1991 just generally than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan rightnow."
p927
aS'It is simply not that violent.'
p928
aS'In fact, my wife is sitting here.'
p929
aS'We met inAfghanistan.'
p930
aS"You can actually have quite a good time in Kabul.It's a relatively peaceful place."
p931
aS'There are restaurants, there are bars.'
p932
aS'You can have aregular social life, which, by the way, you could never have in Baghdad.'
p933
aS"And if you lookat the murder rates in countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, and Russia, they'remuch, much higher than the death rate from the war in Afghanistan."
p934
aS"We're not sayingthat Washington, D.C. is a lost cause."
p935
aS'Maybe some people might say that.'
p936
aS"But we're notsaying that Russia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Columbia is a lost cause, we're notsaying that Mexico is a lost cause, we're not saying Venezuela is a lost cause, yet ouropponents are suggesting it's a lost cause."
p937
aS'And this is ridiculous.'
p938
aS"Another thing we'veheard, of course, if the Karzai government is corrupt, and inefficient, and incompetent,sure, no doubt, but let's look at the neighborhood."
p939
aS"To his west he has Iran withAhmadinejad, who's a Holocaust denier."
p940
aS"We don't need to say much more about him."
p941
aS'Tohis north he has Karimov, of Uzbekistan, who boils people alive as a sort of forensictechnique.'
p942
aS"To his west we have the military dictatorship on and off of Pakistan, Asif AliZardari, the President, who's Mr. 10 percent because he takes at least 10 percent ofeverything.And so if you look at the neighborhood he's in, this is -- Karzai is looking pretty good.And he actually won at the most recent election."
p943
aS"Sure, it wasn't the fairest election inhistory.But he's winning elections."
p944
aS'I mean, this is a democracy.'
p945
aS'Look at the neighborhood.'
p946
aS'[[laughter]] And, in fact, Freedom House, which looks at political freedoms around the world, judgesthat Afghanistan is about as free as any of the immediate neighbors.'
p947
aS"And look at Afghanhistory, think about Karzai's predecessor for a second, the warlords, the Taliban,Najibullah, the Communist dictator, and, of course, the Soviets."
p948
aS'By that standard, bothregionally and historically, Karzai is looking pretty good.'
p949
aS"One of the weakest argumentsthat our opponents didn't even bring up is that foreign forces in Afghanistan are alwaysantibodies."
p950
aS"Well, Nir did say that we're hated."
p951
aS"BBC, hardly pro-American, generallyspeaking, news organization, found that 68 percent of Afghans last year had a favorableview of the U.S. military.Well, you probably can't find 68 percent of the inhabitants of the upper west side whohave a favorable view of the U.S. military.And yet the Afghans do, and that number used to be 85 percent."
p952
aS"Sure, we're losing some [[laughter]] of our popularity, but we are still liked."
p953
aS"They don't want us to go."
p954
aS'They want us toperform on the promises that we seem to have given them early on that we would bring amore relatively prosperous and stable place.'
p955
aS'And since at the heart of a counterinsurgencyis the views of the population, the population is very much on our side.'
p956
aS"Matthewmentioned that we can't afford this war."
p957
aS"Well, we're spending $100 billion on the war.That's one percent of GDP."
p958
aS'Between Vietnam we spent 10 percent of our GDP on thewar.'
p959
aS"And I think this money's well-spent."
p960
aS'First off, the numbers are going to go down aswe spend less money and we have fewer troops.'
p961
aS'Secondly, just -- we were sitting in NewYork, and my wife and I just toured the Trade Center site this morning, and, you know,that cost 3,000 American lives, and it cost $500 billion, and it affects theAmerican economy, five percent of our GDP, had a devastating effect on so many of usin this room.And, you know, to make sure that al-Qaeda cannot come back to Afghanistan is moneyvery, very well-spent, and the idea that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are not somehow alliedis ridiculous.'
p962
aS"Anybody in this room who recalls the May, 2010, attempt in Times Squareby a guy called Faisal Shahzad to blow up an SUV to kill dozens of people on a Saturdaynight at 6:00, luckily it didn't work out, well, he came from the Pakistani Taliban, whichis a group that has been infected ideologically by al-Qaeda."
p963
aS'And the fact that al-Qaeda isa relatively small group doesnt mean very much at all because on 9/11 al-Qaeda onlyconsisted of 200 people.'
p964
aS'And yet it did all this damage to us.'
p965
aS'What the problem with al-Qaeda is, is its ability to reinfect ideologically other groups, and the Taliban is one ofthem.'
p966
