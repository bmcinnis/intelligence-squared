aS"Let's begin with a thought experiment."
p202
aS"Just imagine that you work at JFK International Airport here in New York City, and you're in a Federal Express facility inspecting incoming packages that have just been pulled off of a jet that's landed from Heathrow Airport in London."
p203
aS"And you're clearing these parcels that can be taken on across America and delivered to their destinations."
p204
aS"And you see a package from Somalia, and it's addressed to a synagogue in San Francisco."
p205
aS'"Hmm," you think to yourself, "that\'s kind of unusual.'
p206
aS'" So you call over your supervisor, you take a look at it, you discuss the package, and you decide that you\'re going to put it aside until a bomb- sniffing dog can come over and render its opinion on the matter.'
p207
aS'Congratulations, you just engaged in profiling.'
p208
aS'Now, obviously, packages are not people.'
p209
aS'Fed Ex boxes have neither civil rights nor emotions.'
p210
aS'People do and we always must be aware of and sensitive to that.'
p211
aS'However, in a world of limited time, personnel, and money, we have no choice but to focus on those people who threaten to destroy aircraft and the flying public who ride within them.'
p212
aS'And that is why my team and I urge you to vote in favor of tonight\'s resolution, "U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling.'
p213
aS'" Let me emphasize that we do not advocate letting airport security personnel cater to their own personal ethnic or ecclesiastical biases.'
p214
aS'Instead, we want the TSA and others to recognize that the current threat to passengers and airliners comes almost exclusively from one source, and we all know what it is, young males between about 18 and 35 who practice a fundamentalist strain of the Islamic faith, and generally hail from the Middle East, as well as largely Muslim nations in Africa and South Asia.'
p215
aS"There are exceptions to this profile, but they're quite rare indeed."
p216
aS"We learned about this profile on September 11 when all the hijackers who attacked us that day fit the parameters that I've identified."
p217
aS'Had the security personnel at Newark, Dulles, or Boston-Logan Airports profiled these hijackers, they might have been stopped and nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11 would be with us here today.'
p218
aS'In a few minutes you will hear from my colleague, Asra Nomani.'
p219
aS'She will demonstrate that this profile did not begin on September 11 and it did not end then either.'
p220
aS'My colleague, Bob Baer, a former intelligence officer, will explain that what we advocate is a response to intelligence.'
p221
aS"He also will show that preventing terror at and through America's airports involves responding to the evolving threat profile that faces us at any given time."
p222
aS'Now, mind you, we are not arguing that the TSA should send anyone named Mohammed to be water boarded somewhere between the first class lounge and the Pizza Hut.'
p223
aS'However, if you are a male between about 18 and 35 and are traveling on a Middle Eastern passport or one from a predominantly Muslim country, it might be smart to ask you a few extra questions, carefully peruse your papers, and if things seem unusual we perhaps should take a closer look at your luggage.'
p224
aS'This really is not religious or racial profiling so much as it is terrorist profiling.'
p225
aS'We want to increase, not decrease, the probability that our security personnel will stop terrorists before they can board passenger jets, and once again turn them into bombs and missiles.'
p226
aS'This differs little from what police departments do today to deploy their limited resources in order to raise the odds of successfully reducing crime.'
p227
aS'If the NYPD were seeking a mafia hit man who just flew in from Naples to whack somebody, I doubt the NYPD would dispatch squad cars to 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.'
p228
aS'If you set up a sobriety checkpoint, if youre a police department, you most likely would put it somewhere near bars, not close to churches.'
p229
aS'Similarly, if a wave of bank robberies were committed by a black man between ages 45 and 50, and if he were just under six feet tall, and lived in Manhattans East Village, I would not be shocked if the police stopped me and asked me a few questions.'
p230
aS'Why?'
p231
aS'I perfectly fit that profile.'
p232
aS'Now, would that leave me thrilled and delighted?'
p233
aS'Probably not, but I would know that these law enforcement officers were doing their jobs, and that, I would understand.'
p234
aS'Does my team advocate violating peoples rights?'
p235
aS'Absolutely not.'
p236
aS'Remember, among the rights that officials need to protect is the right to fly on a plane and assume that it will land at your destination with you and your fellow passengers alive and well at your destination.'
p237
aS'That right deserves maximum attention from those who we pay to keep us safe from those who want us dead.'
p238
aS"Our opponents might say that the profile we've identified would miss someone like Timothy McVeigh, the non-Muslim man who blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City."
p239
aS'However, to look more carefully at someone does not mean that you ignore everyone else.'
p240
aS'This resolution is not an either/or proposition.'
p241
aS'Terrorist profiling can exist with wisely applied traditional screening measures for other passengers.'
p242
aS'Finally, what if we avoid terrorist profiling?'
p243
aS'At best, we will keep wasting scarce resources by subjecting everyone to the same time consuming often humiliating searches that have generated such public outrage recently.'
p244
aS'The TSA can keep checking the prosthetic breasts of American women who have endured mastectomies as happened a few months ago to Cathy Bossi, a 32-year veteran airline employee.'
p245
aS'At worst, TSA officers might come face-to-face with a bomb-wielding passenger who fits the terrorist profile but then breezed him through security because they dont want to make him uncomfortable.'
p246
aS'The result could be a deadly airborne attack that we all have feared since September 11.'
p247
aS'My team wants to prevent this from happening and we hope you do, too.'

p354

aS'When I first got the invitation, the assumption was that I would be speaking against the motion.'

p559
aS"It's been a part of my being."
p560
aS'But something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of our Muslim community and inside of the airline industry.'
p561
aS'Inside of our Muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very real interpretation of Islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civilian targets.'
p562
aS'This is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of our community.'
p563
aS"But it's a truth."
p564
aS'And I want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recent years.'
p565
aS'And inside of the airline industry, we have seen Pan Am leave us.'
p566
aS'We have seen TWA die off.'
p567
aS'The airline industry is also under great pressure.'
p568
aS'Airplane crashes, airline security issues have serious consequences, not just on the traveling public but on this really important industry.'
p569
ag121
aS'And this issue of profiling has been the taboo topic in the midst of all of this conversation.'
p570
aS'I do come from a Muslim family.'
p571

p572
aS'My father has Mohammed in his name.'
p573
aS"He's 80-some years old, but he gets pulled at the security checkpoint."
p574
aS'And still I stand before you and I say, profile me.'
p575
aS'Profile my family.'
p576
aS'Profile my father because inside of our Muslim community, I fundamentally believe that we have failed to police ourselves.'
p577
aS'We have failed our country here in America.'
p578
aS'We have failed our world.'
p579
aS'I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to Debra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of September 11.'
p580
aS'And I recognize that we as a nation, both in the U.S. and inside of our Muslim communities, have largely not yet even healed.'
p581
aS'We are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists out there.'
p582
aS'And religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship with issues of violence.'
p583
aS'A wonderful study by the State University of New York at Albany concluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology.'
p584
aS'When you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination.'
p585
aS'We saw that dangerous combination on September 11.'
p586
aS'It was the manifestation of an interpretation inside of our Muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and on airliners.'
p587
aS'There was a fatwa issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when he had created the international Islamic front for fighting the Jews and crusaders.'
p588
aS'And he established very clearly in his marching orders, Bring down their aircraft.'
p589
aS'Have the attack be one of violence that is pitiless.'
p590
aS'He was very clear in what his objective was.'
p591
aS'And I have before me a Koran that comes from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.'
p592
aS'And I want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of our community, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want.'
p593
aS'And in it it says Guide us to the straight way.'
p594
aS"It's a very simple message."
p595
aS'But what the government of Saudi Arabia has done is added into here, unlike the way of the Jews and the Christians.'
p596
aS'And so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makes airports and airliners targets.'
p597
aS"And it's not just the stuff of rhetoric."
p598
aS'Bojinka, 1990s, plot by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from Asia to the U.S. Scotland, Glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the Los Angeles Airport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning had gone out to look out for men of Middle Eastern origin, and so the customs officials actually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at Los Angeles Airport.'
p599
aS'And 2007, JFK Airport, that airport where I arrived, there were young Muslim men who said, "Let us attack John F. Kennedy International Airport because any time you hit Kennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the United States, to hit John F. Kennedy, wow, they love John F. Kennedy, like, he\'s the man.'
p600
aS'If you hit that, this whole country will be mourning.'
p601
aS'You can kill the man twice.'

p624
aS"It's been a part of mybeing."
p625
aS'But something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of ourMuslim community and inside of the airline industry.Inside of our Muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very realinterpretation of Islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civiliantargets.'
p626
aS'This is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of ourcommunity.'
p627
aS"But it's a truth."
p628
aS'And I want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recentyears.'

aS'I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy toDebra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of September 11.'
p642
aS'And I recognize that weas a nation, both in the U.S. and inside of our Muslim communities, have largely not yeteven healed.We are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists outthere.'
p643
aS'And religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship withissues of violence.'
p644
aS'A wonderful study by the State University of New York at Albanyconcluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology.'
p645
aS'Whenyou combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination.'
p646
aS'We sawthat dangerous combination on September 11.'
p647
aS'It was the manifestation of aninterpretation inside of our Muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and onairliners.'
p648
aS'There was a fatwa issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when he had created theinternational Islamic front for fighting the Jews and crusaders.And he established very clearly in his marching orders, Bring down their aircraft.'
p649
aS'Havethe attack be one of violence that is pitiless.'
p650
aS'He was very clear in what his objectivewas.'
p651

p652
aS'AndI want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of ourcommunity, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want.And in it it says Guide us to the straight way.'
p653
aS"It's a very simple message."
p654
aS'But what thegovernment of Saudi Arabia has done is added into here, unlike the way of the Jews andthe Christians.'
p655
aS"And so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makesairports and airliners targets.And it's not just the stuff of rhetoric."
p656
aS'Bojinka, 1990s, plot by Ramzi Yousef and KhalidShaikh Mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from Asia to the U.S. Scotland,Glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the Los AngelesAirport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning hadgone out to look out for men of Middle Eastern origin, and so the customs officialsactually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at LosAngeles Airport.And 2007, JFK Airport, that airport where I arrived, there were young Muslim men whosaid, "Let us attack John F. Kennedy International Airport because any time you hitKennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the United States, to hit John F. Kennedy, wow,they love John F. Kennedy, like, he\'s the man.'

p738
aS'This whole discussion and debate about liberty and security is not a new one.'

p742
aS'" And I said, "No, this is not -- be focused --.'
p743
aS'" The central issue I would argue is not about the different ways and mechanisms and the different strategies, that will be used in profiling, there are three fundamental issues, the first and the foremost is about whether it is legal and constitutional, secondly, what law enforcement tells you, what these different police organizations, there are so many people who are involved in the security sector, what is their general consensus, and the third, and I think a very important point, is what is the impact of this policy on the social fabric of society?'
p744
aS'First, very clearly, it is illegal and unlawful.'
p745
aS'Why?'
p746
aS'When we are saying that a person of a certain religious identity, certain religious belief will be checked, how will you do that?'
p747
aS"You'll ask them -- as Debra rightly pointed out, whether you'll ask them to bring their ID cards, or you will ask, Muslims within the United States about five million or so and all Muslims from around the world to bring an ID, whether they are Muslim."
p748
aS'So by that definition, and Ill have to ask them to also to bring this ID whether theyre Christian, whether theyre Jewish, whether theyre Hindu.'
p749
aS'My argument is that is in principle a violation of the Constitution.'
p750
aS'Lets leave even this argument on the side and let me move on to something which is more profound which is that this kind of religious profiling and racial profiling is not something which is an isolated thing at the airport.'
p751
aS'This is something which transcends, you start looking at that community in a way that is Okay these are the guys who are always stopped at the airport because they pose a certain threat.'
p752
aS'It has an impact on the job opportunities for that community.'
p753
aS'It has an impact on their status in society.'
p754
aS'It has an impact on the kids.'
p755
aS'And I give you a few examples also about how perhaps later on, examples which tell you what the kids from these communities, Muslim community here we are talking about, go through because then there is a threatened environment where you blame the whole community and to Asra with all due respect.'
p756
aS'I am absolutely not ready to apologize for all the bigots and the narrow-minded people who conduct terrorism.'
p757
aS'I would argue, just look at the data bases.'
p758
aS'Theres a new study which is not mentioned, only in the academic circles, but was mentioned in 2010 on CNN.'
p759
aS'It tells you very clearly that the whole threat about extremism coming from the Muslims is an exaggerated thing.'
p760
aS'Look at the latest Rand study, its a major think tank, its not some small research institute in some corner.'
p761
aS'Its a major think-tank getting funding from U.S. government also.'
p762
aS'Rand Corporation says the total number of terrorism incidences which involved radicals from the U.S. --were 46.'
p763
aS'In some cases there was only one person involved, in other cases, about three people.'
p764
aS'Its another matter how many of them were convicted.'
p765
aS'But just compare this data set which is on the FBIs website.'
p766
aS'Compare the total number of terrorist attacks within the United States from 1970 to 2009.'
p767
aS'It is so very clear.'
p768
aS'The number of terrorist attacks, for example, those that were happening in 1970s where much more lethal, from much more diverse communities.'
p769
aS'So the larger argument I am making is we need smarter strategies.'
p770
aS'We need strategies which will be able to utilize with limited resources.'
p771
aS'Another issue, related to this is, this often is a cover-up, a cover-up for bureaucratic incompetence and their failures.'
p772
aS'Its very easy for them to say because we our intelligence has failed because of all the different ways we could have profiled those terrorists have failed, if you cannot distinguish between a Pakistani Taliban or an Afghan Taliban and so many other groups.'
p773
aS'The tendency is to just call all of them al Qaeda, on one side, just call--on the other side are people who are Taliban.'
p774
aS'It is very important to note how many of these groups are posing a terror threat to the United States.'
p775
aS'Im not interested in the total number of terrorist attacks all over the world.'
p776
aS'The suicide bombers in Sri Lanka or whats happening with the Islamic movement in Uzbekistan in Central Asia or the suicide attacks in Pakistan for that matter.'
p777
aS'I am as a Pakistani-American interested in those people who are attacking or who are posing a direct threat to the United States.'
p778
aS'Look at the data set in the last nine years and it will make it very obvious.'
p779
aS'One last personal anecdote and there are many other arguments about the legality of the whole issue that Ill come to later, I would even argue that racial and religious profiling is already taking place.'

S'Well thank you very much and thank you to my opponents and my colleagues for what I think has been an excellent and lively debate.'
p3354
aS'I think the general position that weve heard from the other side is that since its impossible to catch everyone who might pose a threat to our country and our flying public and who want to kill us, therefore we shouldnt even attempt to find those who might have those malicious intentions.'
p3355
aS'It is true that you might, in an effort to catch everyone who happens to be a Muslim, perhaps not catch someone like Jose Padilla who was of Hispanic background and converted to Islam or perhaps people who have gone through Prislam as I believe Debra put it who have gone to prison and been radicalized there and might be black and therefore they might slip through the profile.'
p3356
aS'But because they might not go through the profile doesnt mean that we ignore the fact that people from the Middle East who are Islamic, unfortunately they represent the profile of the people who threaten this country at this time.'
p3357
aS'I think you certainly can check by looking at things like passports which definitely will give us a sense of where they come from maybe not on a domestic flight but certainly on international flights and people going through international airports.'
p3358
aS'I also think that if al Qaeda gets smart and says Well I guess theyre looking for people who like those who were 9/11 hijackers we probably should go to the trouble of finding women who are blonde haired, blue-eyed.'
p3359
aS'Let al Qaeda go to the trouble of finding blonde-haired, blue-eyed women who agree with them and want to blow themselves up then its going to be a lot more difficult for them to fish around in that pool than to find more Muslim men who are 18 to 35.'

p3363
aS'Daddy, are we criminals?'

aS'That is very tragic and very sad.'
p3365
aS'But I think the other consequence we must remember is if somebody slips through and we have something like the plane flying over Detroit which was attacked; fortunately, the bomb did not go off.'
p3366
