p355
aS'So this is all very new and exciting for me.'
p356
aS'I want to make one thing clear before we start and that is that this is not a debate about banning football nor is it a debate about whether there are merits to playing football.'
p357
aS"You will hear I'm quite sure from Mr. Green and Mr. Whitlock that all kinds of wonderful things happen when you play football, you learn camaraderie and discipline and teamwork."
p358
aS'All of those things are true, and neither Buzz nor I are going to dispute any of them.'
p359
aS'This debate is about a very specific question.'
p360
aS'Right now in colleges across the country schools field football teams for the purpose of offering recreation to the players and offering entertainment to fans and students and alumni.'
p361
aS'And the question is, is that appropriate.'
p362
aS'Buzz is going to say, "That\'s not appropriate because the players are exploited," and I\'m going to say that, "It\'s not appropriate because schools should not be in the business of encouraging young men to hit themselves over the head.'
p363
aS'" Let\'s talk a little bit about hitting over the head.'
p364
aS'Start with a very simple -- the simple physics of football.'
p365
aS'The human brain is a mass of soft tissue that is suspended within a hard skull, right?'
p366
aS'Every time you get hit, that soft tissue rattles around inside your skull.'
p367
aS'And the effect of that rattling around is to stretch and sometimes tear the connections between your nerve cells.'
p368
aS'In the course of everyday life, that almost never happens.'
p369
aS'In the course of playing football, that happens all the time.'
p370
aS'It is not unusual in the course of a game for a player to sustain hits to the head of between 40 and 100 Gs.'
p371
aS'To put that in perspective, if you were to get in your car and not put on your seatbelt and drive at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall so that your forehead struck the dashboard of the car, that would be a hit of 100 Gs, right?'
p372
aS'If you reversed your car and went and did it over and over again so that you hit the brick wall 30 to 40 times at speeds between 20 and 25 miles an hour, that would be the equivalent of a football game.'
p373
aS'If you reversed your car and over the course of the next three months drove it at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall 1,000 times, that would be the equivalent of a college football season.'
p374
aS"Now, you're going to hear from Mr. Whitlock and Mr. Green, they're going to try and tell you that there are ways around this fact, that if we have better rules or better treatment of concussions or better helmets, the effect of that kind of injury can be minimized."
p375
aS'That is a fantasy.'
p376
aS'There are ways to cut down on the number of concussions, but concussions are only a small part of the problem.'
p377
aS'The real issue is all of those thousands of tiny hits.'
p378
aS"There isn't a helmet in the world that can be designed that can take the sting out of those hits, and there is no way to play this game of football and remove those hits without turning tackle football into touch football, and the last I checked this was not a debate about whether we should ban touch football on college campuses."
p379
aS'I once watched a football practice at the University of North Carolina where the players were playing without pads; they were just doing a simple scrimmage.'
p380
aS'In the course of 20 minutes, one of their running backs sustained hits to the head of 79, 60, and 30 Gs.'
p381
aS'In 15 minutes, he had the equivalent of three car accidents.'
p382
aS"Now, what's the effect of all of that neurological trauma?"
p383
aS'Well, we know.'
p384
aS'It\'s a condition called, "CTE," which brings about premature death and the equivalent of Alzheimer\'s in people who are as young as 40 years old.'
p385
aS"I've seen pictures of the brain scans of people with CTE and it looks like someone drove a truck across their brain."
p386
aS"Now, we don't know how many ex-football players have this condition because you can't diagnose it until they die, until you do an autopsy of your brain, but there are people who estimate there are as many as 20 percent of football players who have this condition."
p387
aS'And we also know that there are players as young as 18 years old who have been diagnosed with CTE.'
p388
aS'Its a problem that begins in high school and is made worse during college.'
p389
aS'Now, I have no problem whatsoever with grown men in full possession of the facts and risks of the game choosing to participate in a potentially lethal profession, right?'
p390
aS'I have no problem with people who smoke cigarettes, I have no problem with people who do deep sea diving, I have no problem with people who want to drive their motorcycle without a helmet on.'
p391
aS'If you want to play Russian roulette with your brain, fine.'
p392
aS'But college is a very, very different matter.'
p393
aS'Every single college in this country, rich or poor, big or small, is supported by the taxpayer dollars of the people in this room.'
p394
aS'They are subsidized by us, they are given immunity from taxes, they are supported by laws of Congress, by acts of local legislatures.'
p395
aS'They are in every way funded by the people in this room.'
p396
aS'And the reason for that special relationship between us and the world of higher education is that they are charged with a sacred trust, and that is to prepare the minds of young men and women to lead lives -- the minds of young -- to lead productive lives as full citizens of the United States.'
p397
aS'And nowhere, nowhere, in that social contract does it say that its okay to promote and encourage young men to hit themselves over and over again in the head in the name of entertainment.'

p483
aS'She said, Youve had too many concussions.'
p484
aS'And I have.'
p485
aS'And I have.'
p486
aS'And I agree with our opponents, Mr. Gladwell and Mr. Bissinger, in a lot of ways.'
p487
aS'Football is a brutal game and I have grave concerns about concussions and the impact of concussions.'
p488
aS'I also agree that I think college football players, because of the revenues that they generate, should be paid I think a small stipend.'
p489
aS'I think that they deserve that.'
p490
aS'And so in some ways I do agree with them.'
p491
aS'But banning college football -- I mean, so I had to first -- I had to get over my initial horror at the notion because, of course, football for me has done a lot of tremendous things.'
p492
aS'And then I looked at, you know, just our country, our society in general, and I thought about football and what it does in the colleges and how its a unifier.'
p493
aS'Not just the guys on the teams, not just unifying people from different places and different ethnicities and different religions into one solid unit that learns to work together, but unifying a campus, unifying the students, unifying the faculty, unifying the alumni, unifying sometimes entire towns, communities, and whole cities.'
p494
aS'And so, in that respect, to me, I said, you know, How could we?'
p495
aS'How could we ban -- college football is a wonderful thing.'
p496
aS'But then I wanted to look at it and I wanted to look at the numbers, because obviously my opponents are highly intelligent men, theyre passionate men, theyre very learned, and I said, you know, What is it?'
p497
aS'Whats behind this?'
p498
aS'And so I looked into the numbers as far as what does college football -- what are the benefits of college football and what are the detriments?'
p499
aS'Well, the detriments certainly are the head injuries.'
p500
aS'Now, Ive got to say this because weve got to get things straight from the beginning about the concussions and the g-forces, because Mr. Gladwell talked about 100 g-forces when you hit your head into a brick wall at 25 miles an hour 30 times a game.'
p501
aS'That does not happen in a college football game.'
p502
aS'That does not happen in an NFL football game because when you get hit at 120 -- at 100 Gs, you get a concussion, and when you get a concussion, now more than ever, you are taken out of the game and you are put into some rehab program.'
p503
aS"Now, back when I played, back when Jason played, it wasn't like that."
p504
aS'It was -- do you know where you are?'
p505
aS'No.'
p506
aS'How many fingers do I have up?'
p507
aS'Four.'
p508
aS'Okay.'
p509
aS"That's close enough."
p510
aS"You're ready to go back in."
p511
aS"It's not like that anymore."
p512
aS'And so the game is evolving to become safer and safer, as safe as it can be.'
p513
aS'But it will never be completely safe.'
p514
aS"It won't be completely safe."
p515
aS'So what I said to myself is, well, let me look at some things that are maybe as unsafe or maybe even more unsafe than playing the game of football.'
p516
aS"And so, of course, automobile accidents came to mind because the mortality rate is about a hundred times higher for men in that age range that they're going to die in an automobile accident than they're going to die on the football field."
p517
aS'And then I said, well, look, how about -- how about going out and riding your bicycle?'
p518
aS"That's right."
p519
aS"That's more dangerous, or downhill skiing."
p520
aS'And then I said, well, let me look at sports.'
p521
aS'And so I went to the NCAA, and I looked at their sports, and I looked at a study that was done at the University of North Carolina.'
p522
aS'I looked at the study of the fatalities, direct fatalities and the sports that are more dangerous than football.'
p523
aS'Equestrian riding, female downhill skiing, lacrosse, water polo and baseball.'
p524
aS'And then I went to indirect fatalities, and I looked, and I found that rowing, basketball, skiing, water polo and swimming are all more dangerous than football.'
p525
aS"And so if we're going to say, well, football has to be banned, then I think it's only right that we pretty much have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and the safety."
p526
aS'The other thing that I just have to disagree with, with Mr. Gladwell -- and I know this is dangerous territory for me -- but he talked about grown men.'
p527
aS"And to suggest that college football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's -- that's just not true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to Afghanistan or wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country."
p528
aS'And those are grown men.'
p529
aS'And so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, I think that they have the -- they have the right to make that decision.'
p530
aS'So those are the things that are maybe against.'
p531
aS"And I don't think that it's that dangerous."
p532
aS'What are the things that are for?'
p533
aS'Education.'
p534
aS'Mr. Bissinger said, well, you know, all you get is a scholarship.'
p535
aS'All you get is a scholarship?'
p536
aS"If you go to my alma mater, that's a $250,000 plus scholarship."
p537
aS"That's the value of that education."
p538
aS'So you do get an education.'
p539
aS'How many scholarship football players are there in this country every year?'
p540
aS'23,000.'
p541
aS'And the surplus from the game of football is used for what?'
p542
aS'Well, maybe it is for research, maybe it is for physical , but a lot of it is also used for Title 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educations that they might never have had before.'
p543
aS"And to suggest that football and sports aren't educating, especially football, aren't educating students, I looked at that too."
p544
aS"In the general population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, and it's going down."
p545
aS"It's of grave concern."
p546
aS'NFL -- college football players in the last 25 years have gone from a 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate.'
p547
aS"So not only are they being educated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers."
p548
aS'For me, the game of football -- and I -- well, I was serious about the lessons of football on an individual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance.'
p549
aS'And I know my partner, Jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn.'
p550
aS'Those are wonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves.'
p551
aS'So I hope that you will all vote tonight to not ban college football.'

aS"And so if we'regoing to say, well, football has to be banned, then I think it's only right that we prettymuch have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and thesafety."
p610
aS'The other thing that I just have to disagree with, with Mr. Gladwell -- and I knowthis is dangerous territory for me -- but he talked about grown men.'
p611
aS"And to suggest thatcollege football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's -- that's justnot true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to Afghanistanor wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country."
p612
aS'And those aregrown men.'
p613
aS'And so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, I think that they have the --they have the right to make that decision.So those are the things that are maybe against.'

p615

aS'So you doget an education.'
p622
aS'How many scholarship football players are there in this country everyyear?'
p623
aS'23,000.'
p624
aS'And the surplus from the game of football is used for what?'
p625
aS'Well, maybeit is for research, maybe it is for physical , but a lot of it is also used forTitle 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educationsthat they might never have had before.'
p626
aS"And to suggest that football and sports aren'teducating, especially football, aren't educating students, I looked at that too."
p627
aS"In thegeneral population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, andit's going down.It's of grave concern."
p628
aS'NFL -- college football players in the last 25 years have gone froma 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate.'
p629
aS"So not only are they beingeducated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers."
p630
aS'For me,the game of football -- and I -- well, I was serious about the lessons of football on anindividual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance.'
p631
aS'And I know mypartner, Jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn.'
p632
aS'Those arewonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves.'
