S'John, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and Bloomberg, thank you for hosting the debate on the issues.'
p302
aS'Ideas have consequences, and debating ideas is always important for a free society.'
p303
aS'Since the Enlightenment it has generally been accepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key to unleashing human potential.'
p304
aS'Freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things, and America is proof that freedom works.'
p305
aS'Across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness.'
p306
aS'Within our own country states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of law have tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migration where people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom.'
p307
aS'When economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes.'
p308
aS'And our argument tonight is pretty simple.'
p309
aS'Our economic freedom is imperiled.'
p310
aS'Just two years ago the national debt of our country was 40 percent of our annual production.'
p311
aS'Two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the current budget that Congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by America.'
p312
aS'Interest payments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if every assumption of the Obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes collected in America just to pay interest on the federal debt.'
p313
aS'If the Obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxes collected in America in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt.'
p314
aS'If this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is?'
p315
aS'What could be?'
p316
aS'This is big government stifling the American spirit.'
p317
aS'But the crisis is so much greater than these frightening numbers would lead you to believe.'
p318
aS'If you listen to Washington, this problem is easy to solve.'
p319
aS'All youve got to do is tax rich people.'
p320
aS'Well rich people already pay more of the taxes than at any time in American history.'
p321
aS'And the problem is there are just not enough of them.'
p322
aS'Our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entity in the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldnt deal with our deficit, much less our debt.'
p323
aS'And its not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percent we have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes in peacetime in American history.'
p324
aS'You often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people.'
p325
aS'But the reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium size businesses have changed the way theyre taxed from corporate entities to being taxed as individuals.'
p326
aS'The finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all the income of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes from partnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter S. In short, from small businesses filing as individuals.'
p327
aS'The policy that were told will tax John Q. Astor in reality will tax Joe Brown and Son Hardware Store, and heres the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs.'
p328

S'John, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and Bloomberg, thank youfor hosting the debate on the issues.'
p349
aS'Ideas have consequences, and debating ideas isalways important for a free society.'
p350
aS'Since the Enlightenment it has generally beenaccepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key tounleashing human potential.'
p351
aS'Freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinarythings, and America is proof that freedom works.Across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create morejobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness.'
p352
aS'Within our owncountry states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of lawhave tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migrationwhere people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom.'
p353
aS'Wheneconomic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes.'
p354
aS'And our argument tonight is prettysimple.'
p355
aS'Our economic freedom is imperiled.'
p356
aS'Just two years ago the national debt of ourcountry was 40 percent of our annual production.Two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the currentbudget that Congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by America.'
p357
aS'Interestpayments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if everyassumption of the Obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out ofevery dollar of income taxes collected in America just to pay interest on the federal debt.If the Obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxescollected in America in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt.If this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is?'
p358
aS'What could be?'
p359
aS'This is biggovernment stifling the American spirit.'
p360
aS'But the crisis is so much greater than thesefrightening numbers would lead you to believe.'
p361
aS'If you listen to Washington, this problemis easy to solve.'
p362
aS'All youve got to do is tax rich people.'
p363
aS'Well rich people already paymore of the taxes than at any time in American history.'
p364
aS'And the problem is there are justnot enough of them.'
p365
aS'Our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entityin the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldnt deal with our deficit, much less ourdebt.'
p366
aS'And its not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percentwe have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes inpeacetime in American history.You often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people.'
p367
aS'Butthe reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium sizebusinesses have changed the way theyre taxed from corporate entities to being taxed asindividuals.'
p368
aS'The finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all theincome of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes frompartnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter S. In short, fromsmall businesses filing as individuals.The policy that were told will tax John Q. Astor in reality will tax Joe Brown and SonHardware Store, and heres the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds ofthe jobs.'
p369
aS'It is simply not feasible, given where we are in the economic cycle, to beraising taxes on small business.'
p370
aS'The solution to excess spending is not excess taxes; itsless spending.'

p407
aS'We know a lot about financialcrises across our own economy over time and around the world.'
p408
aS"And we know that theyare the result of a failure, a collapse, a mess created by the private sector, created byoverleveraged banks, created by people who take on debt they cannot finance, created bypeople who engage in sophisticated trading, buy a credit default swap, don't even knowwhat a credit default swap is.Think I'll buy one; it's an innovation."
p409
aS'When you have a major financial crisis and therecession which follows, the government has to help clean up the mess.'
p410
aS"And we knowthis over time from the tulip crisis of several hundred years ago to today's financial crisis.And we know -- you know what we know?"
p411
aS"That when government's clean up the mess,that is stabilize the banking system, that is make sure demand deposits are there whenyou go to the bank, make sure your money market funds don't fall below a dollar, thegovernment has to supply capital to the financial institutions to do that."
p412
aS'The governmenthas to also deal with the slowdown in the economy, the recession, the loss of job, thebankruptcies, the closures of plants.And that is what economic stimulus is meant to do.'
p413
aS'And does it work perfectly?'
p414
aS'No.Does it work?'
p415
aS'Yes.'
p416
aS'If you look at what government has done, and you look at theprojections of any macro model in the U.S. economy, you will see that the stimulus wasprojected to produce about 3.5 million jobs.'
p417
aS"And that's exactly what it has done.So one thing I will say is that we are dealing right at a moment in time where we have amess that has to be cleaned up."
p418
aS"It's a little bit -- I think of it more broadly as governmentshave to clean up messes occasionally."
p419
aS"For example, let's take Katrina."
p420
aS"Let's takeHurricane Katrina."
p421
aS'There was a failure to clean up a mess that was a governmentresponsibility to clean up.'
p422
aS'And by the way, one of the reasons Hurricane Katrina causedso much damage, there was another government failure.'

aS'government has spent over many years to build education infrastructure andtechnology which play into the spirit of America.They are part of the innovative spirit of America.Now, there is a problem.'
p442
aS'A problem is that the government has, over time, been spendingless on that as a share of total government spending.'
p443
aS"And it's been spending less on thatas a share of our economy."
p444
aS"Our economy's gotten bigger."
p445
aS'Those kinds of governmentinvestments have become less important as a share of the economy.'
p446
aS'Why?'
p447
aS"What's goingon?"
p448
aS"Well, one -- let's look for a minute at defense, because when we're thinking about thesize of government, think about defense in the U.S."
p449
aS"The U.S. has 4.3 percent of theworld's population and spends 43 percent of global defense spending, 43 percent, almosthalf of the world's defense spending is spent right here in the U.S. We are defending theU.S."
p450
aS"And we're not just defending the U.S. We are defending much of the rest of theworld.We don't hear about that from the critics of the size of government."
p451
aS"We need to talkabout the government spending almost 20 percent of its total budget on defense, itspending much less on innovation, education, infrastructure, failing infrastructure.Now, let me just get to a couple facts about the size of government comparativelyspeaking, because you might say, God, the U.S. government's so big."
p452
aS'U.S. governmentas a share of GDP has really not changed very much in the last 20 years.'
p453
aS'Actually, Iheard the applause for Ronald Reagan, President Reagan.'
p454
aS'Government spending underhis term actually rose to about almost 24.5 percent of GDP.'
p455
aS'It fell under PresidentClinton and under President George W. Bush.'

aS'And by the way, government spending as a shareof GDP or government tax revenues as a share of GDP, if you look at the mostcompetitive nations in the world, and you line up the U.S., you will see that the U.S. isone of the most competitive nations in the world.'

aS'Theyre the two high priests of supply-side economics, what is also referred to as voodoo economics.'
p819

p820
aS'Its a religion because its based not on facts or science but on faith.'
p821
aS'They have ten commandments.'
p822
aS'Big government and most government spending are always wasteful and stifles the American spirit, first.'
p823
aS'Second, free markets always know best, they never fail, they never experience a national crisis.'
p824
aS'Three, its best to have no regulation or supervision of markets, especially financial markets.'
p825
aS'Four, high taxes are bad especially for the rich and the very rich.'
p826
aS'Five, lowering tax rates increases revenues overall, the Laffer Curve doesnt work.'
p827
aS'Even if lower taxes lead to higher deficits, higher deficits dont matter.'
p828
aS'Seven, even if lower tax rates cause higher deficits, thats good because youve got to starve the beast, youve got to force the government to cut back its own size.'
p829
aS'That doesnt work either.'
p830
aS'Eight, government spending is always wasteful unless its for foreign wars that cost trillions of dollars.'
p831
aS'Nine, subsidies are bad but subsidies and tax breaks for big business are always good even if they bust the budget.'
p832
aS'Ten, income and wealth inequality are good; as Gordon Gekko said, greed is good.'
p833
aS'In capitalism it is the survival of the fittest or the richest.'
p834
aS'Big government should have nothing to do with income inequality.'
p835
aS'Now these are the principles, but with a bunch of experiments in the 80s and the last ten years which means 2001 to 2008 during the Bush administration -- we had the system of free markets and laissez-faire economics, no regulation, supervision of the financial system, lower tax rates and supply-side voodoo economics and a rhetoric of bashing big government while increasingly spending on government spending, discretionary spending and on the military.'
p836
aS'What did we end up with?'
p837
aS'We ended up with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, two expensive foreign wars financed with two trillion dollars worth of debt, with budget deficits that were already over a trillion dollars when Obama became president.'
p838
aS'So who bailed out Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, AIG, Citi, Goldman-Sachs, an entire financial system with 700 billion TARP money?'
p839
aS'Was it the Democrats?'
p840
aS'No, it was during the Bush administration.'
p841
aS'So who are the culprits of this economic, fiscal, and financial mess?'
p842
aS'Is it big government?'
p843
aS'No.'
p844
aS'The culprits are here, by the way, two of them are here, Mr. Laffer, Mr. Gramm.'
p845
aS'And I mean it literally.'
p846
aS'Paul Krugman listed Mr. Gramm as the number two person responsible for the economic crisis after Alan Greenspan.'
p847
aS'If you believe that Krugman is biased, both CNN and Time Magazine put them in the list of the top 20 people to blame for the financial crisis.'
p848
aS'What his record is is he has been bashing big government forever, for decades, but he was a leading author by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that essentially repealed the Glass- Steagall Act, that led to what is called the CitiGroup Relief Act, that led to the merger, the disastrous merger, of CitiCorp and the Travelers group.'
p849
aS'Now theyre under government control, these financial institutions.'
p850
aS'And as we know, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was one of the many causes of the recent financial crisis.'
p851
aS'Gramm was also one of the five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 that essentially limited any regulation of credit derivatives and other derivatives, with even an Enron loop hole in it that essentially limited any regulation of energy futures.'
p852
aS'You know what ended up happening with Enron.'
p853
aS'It went to a scandal and bankruptcy.'
p854
aS'Other parts of this act limited regulation and supervision of credit derivatives, of CDSs and other derivatives as well at the center of this financial crisis.'
p855
aS'Warren Buffet calls these derivatives weapons of mass destruction.'
p856
aS'So thats the record.'
p857
aS'Does he think hes responsible for some of the financial crisis?'
p858
aS'Not only doesnt he, but in a July 2008 interview, when he was advisor to McCain, he said that the nation was not even in a recession.'
p859
aS'He said, youve heard of mental depression.'
p860
aS'This is a mental recession.'
p861
aS'Weve sort of become a nation of whiners.'
p862
aS'You just hear the constant whining, complaining about the loss of competitiveness, American decline.'
p863
aS'During this mental recession, 8.5 million people lost their jobs, unemployment went to 10 percent, 17 percent including discouraged workers or partially-employed workers.'
p864
aS'And of course Mr. Gramm and Mr. Laffer believe that giving unemployment benefits because of loss of jobs and income is bad because it reduces the incentive to find new work.'
p865
aS'Now whats the record instead of Mr. Laffer?'
p866
aS'He is the father of the Laffer Curve, the idea that if you lower tax rates, revenue is eventually going to be become higher.'
p867
aS'Now, there is zero, zero evidence that tax rates pay for themselves.'
p868
aS'I could cite hundreds of economic studies, but I will cite just one person, Greg Mankiw, who was the main economic advisor of George Bush, W. He is also a professor at Harvard.'
p869
aS'He said the following thing about the idea of a Laffer Curve working, in a part of his textbook called Charlatans and Cranks.'
p870
aS'When politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable results they anticipate.'
p871
aS"After Reagan's election, Congress passed the cut in tax rates that Reagan advocated."
p872
aS'But the tax cut did not cause tax revenue to rise.'
p873
aS'And I could cite hundreds of other studies suggesting that there is absolutely no evidence that reducing tax rates increases revenues.'
p874
aS'David Stockman, who was the budget director for Reagan, most recently in an op-ed in the New York Times titled How My Republican Party Destroyed the American Economy.'
p875
aS'And he started his op-ed by saying, If there was such a thing as a chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extend unaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to bankruptcy filing.'
p876
aS"That's the lesson."
p877
aS'Now, we realize that tax cuts do not reduce budget deficits.'
p878
aS'They increase them sharply.'
p879
aS'So they change the argument in favor of tax cuts.'
p880
aS'They realize that tax cuts are to budget deficit.'
p881
aS"But they say, first of all, it doesn't matter."
p882
aS"Or if does matter, it's going to starve the beast."
p883
aS'To have low tax rates is going to force the government to cut government spending.'
p884
aS'That was the argument.'
p885
aS'The result was just the opposite.'
p886
aS'When Bush came to power in 2001, discretionary spending was 260 billion at that time.'
p887
aS'By the time he left the administration eight years later, it was 420 billion, twice as much.'

aS'They have ten commandments.Big government and most government spending are always wasteful and stifles theAmerican spirit, first.'
p906
aS'Second, free markets always know best, they never fail, they neverexperience a national crisis.'
p907
aS'Three, its best to have no regulation or supervision ofmarkets, especially financial markets.'
p908
aS'Four, high taxes are bad especially for the rich andthe very rich.'
p909
aS'Five, lowering tax rates increases revenues overall, the Laffer Curvedoesnt work.Even if lower taxes lead to higher deficits, higher deficits dont matter.'
p910
aS'Seven, even if [[laughter]] lower tax rates cause higher deficits, thats good because youve got to starve the beast,youve got to force the government to cut back its own size.'
p911
aS'That doesnt work either.Eight, government spending is always wasteful unless its for foreign wars that costtrillions of dollars.'
p912
aS'Nine, subsidies are bad but subsidies and tax breaks for big business are always goodeven if they bust the budget.Ten, income and wealth inequality are good; as Gordon Gekko said, greed is good.'
p913
aS'In [[laughter]] capitalism it is the survival of the fittest or the richest.'
p914
aS'Big government should havenothing to do with income inequality.'
p915
aS'Now these are the principles, but with a bunch ofexperiments in the 80s and the last ten years which means 2001 to 2008 during the Bushadministration -- we had the system of free markets and laissez-faire economics, noregulation, supervision of the financial system, lower tax rates and supply-side voodooeconomics and a rhetoric of bashing big government while increasingly spending ongovernment spending, discretionary spending and on the military.'
p916
aS'What did we end upwith?We ended up with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression,two expensive foreign wars financed with two trillion dollars worth of debt, with budgetdeficits that were already over a trillion dollars when Obama became president.'
p917
aS'So whobailed out Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, AIG, Citi, Goldman-Sachs, an entirefinancial system with 700 billion TARP money?'
p918
aS'Was it the Democrats?'
p919
aS'No, it wasduring the Bush administration.'
p920
aS'So who are the culprits of this economic, fiscal, andfinancial mess?'
p921
aS'Is it big government?'
p922
aS'No.'
p923
aS'The culprits are here, by the way, two ofthem are here, Mr. Laffer, Mr. Gramm.'
p924
aS'And I mean it literally.'
p925
aS'Paul Krugman listed Mr. Gramm as the number two personresponsible for the economic crisis after Alan Greenspan.'
p926
aS'If you believe that Krugman isbiased, both CNN and Time Magazine put them in the list of the top 20 people to blamefor the financial crisis.What his record is is he has been bashing big government forever, for decades, but hewas a leading author by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that essentially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, that led to what is called the CitiGroup Relief Act, that led to the merger,the disastrous merger, of CitiCorp and the Travelers group.'
p927
aS'Now theyre undergovernment control, these financial institutions.'
p928
aS'And as we know, the repeal of theGlass-Steagall Act was one of the many causes of the recent financial crisis.Gramm was also one of the five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures ModernizationAct of 2000 that essentially limited any regulation of credit derivatives and otherderivatives, with even an Enron loop hole in it that essentially limited any regulation ofenergy futures.'
p929
aS'You know what ended up happening with Enron.'
p930
aS'It went to a scandaland bankruptcy.'
p931
aS'Other parts of this act limited regulation and supervision of creditderivatives, of CDSs and other derivatives as wellat the center of this financial crisis.'
p932
aS'Warren Buffet calls these derivatives weapons ofmass destruction.'
p933
aS'So thats the record.Does he think hes responsible for some of the financial crisis?'
p934
aS'Not only doesnt he, butin a July 2008 interview, when he was advisor to McCain, he said that the nation was noteven in a recession.'
p935
aS'He said, youve heard of mental depression.'
p936
aS'This is a mentalrecession.'
p937
aS'Weve sort of become a nation of whiners.'
p938
aS'You just hear the constantwhining, complaining about the loss of competitiveness, American decline.'
p939
aS'During thismental recession, 8.5 million people lost their jobs, unemployment went to 10 percent, 17percent including discouraged workers or partially-employed workers.'
p940
aS'And of courseMr.'
p941
aS'Gramm and Mr. Laffer believe that giving unemployment benefits because of loss ofjobs and income is bad because it reduces the incentive to find new work.Now whats the record instead of Mr. Laffer?'
p942
aS'He is the father of the Laffer Curve, theidea that if you lower tax rates, revenue is eventually going to be become higher.'
p943
aS'Now,there is zero, zero evidence that tax rates pay for themselves.'
p944
aS'I could cite hundreds ofeconomic studies, but I will cite just one person, Greg Mankiw, who was the maineconomic advisor of George Bush, W.He is also a professor at Harvard.'
p945
aS'He said the following thing about the idea of a LafferCurve working, in a part of his textbook called Charlatans and Cranks.When politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the [[laughter]] desirable results they anticipate.'
p946
aS"After Reagan's election, Congress passed the cut in taxrates that Reagan advocated."
p947
aS'But the tax cut did not cause tax revenue to rise.'
p948
aS'And Icould cite hundreds of other studies suggesting that there is absolutely no evidence thatreducing tax rates increases revenues.'
p949
aS'David Stockman, who was the budget director forReagan, most recently in an op-ed in the New York Times titled How My RepublicanParty Destroyed the American Economy.'
p950
aS'And he started his op-ed by saying, If therewas such a thing as a chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extendunaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to bankruptcy filing.'
p951
aS"That's the lesson."
p952
aS'Now,we realize that tax cuts do not reduce budget deficits.They increase them sharply.'
p953
aS'So they change the argument in favor of tax cuts.'
p954
aS'Theyrealize that tax cuts are to budget deficit.'
p955
aS"But they say, first of all, itdoesn't matter."
p956
aS"Or if does matter, it's going to starve the beast."
p957
aS'To have low tax rates isgoing to force the government to cut government spending.'
p958
aS'That was the argument.'
p959
aS'Theresult was just the opposite.'
p960
aS'When Bush came to power in 2001, discretionary spendingwas 260 billion at that time.'
p961
aS'By the time he left the administration eight years later, itwas 420 billion, twice as much.'
