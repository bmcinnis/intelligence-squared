S'Thanks, John.'
p137
aS'And thank you for being here tonight to discuss what I think is one of the most important issues that we have, really, as a nation facing us.'
p138
aS'You know, Americans are not a group of people that sit out a revolution.'
p139
aS'If you think about our founding and where we come from, we began with a revolution, the American Revolutionary War.'
p140
aS'And there have been a few revolutions in our time as well that Americans have not just participated in, but theyve led.'
p141
aS'Think about the Industrial Revolution where we established really our ability to be an economic powerhouse.'
p142
aS'Or, more recently, the information revolution where we reaffirmed in the minds of the world our ability as innovators and creators and inventors, people who really understand the power of technological development.'
p143
aS'What is this revolution that is upon us now?'
p144
aS'It is the clean energy revolution.'
p145
aS'And its global.'
p146
aS'And the question we have before us as Americans is will we lead or will we follow?'
p147
aS'Will we accept a place on the sidelines, or will we actively participate in moving this issue ahead?'
p148
aS'Tonight Im joined by Kassia Yanosek, whos my partner in this.'
p149
aS'And youre going to get to hear Kassia as well, but we stand for the proposition tonight that, in fact, clean energy can drive Americas economic recovery.'
p150
aS'Energy itself, if you think about the revenues generated globally, the largest industry in terms of revenue generation.'
p151
aS'So, if we get it right, it absolutely can be a significant part of our economic recovery.'
p152
aS'And its important for us to define the terms to some extent.'
p153
aS'When people hear clean energy in a lot of places in the world, they think its just wind or just solar.'
p154
aS'Kassia and I tonight, were going to talk about clean energy in this broad spectrum.'
p155
aS'It is about renewable, about solar and wind and geothermal biomass, but its also about all those parts of the spectrum that involve the things that were doing to promote clean energy, and the research and development laboratories across this country, both public and private, how you commercialize that technology and get it into the marketplace, those things that involve transmission and Smart Grid technology that help us to manage loads on grid, those parts of the clean energy world that involve transportation -- think electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles, hybrid cars -- but again, the broad spectrum.'
p156
aS'When we think about clean energy, we do think about natural gas and believe that natural gas and nuclear and even clean coal can perhaps play a role in building out a clean energy economy in America and that it has to be every part of that, from stem to stern, in terms of our thinking about it.'
p157
aS'Its important for us to understand as well that workforce development has to be part of our policy considerations.'
p158
aS'So one of the reasons Im here tonight and one of the reasons I was fortunate to be invited is because, as the Colorado governor, I said in Colorado, Were going to build a new energy economy.'
p159
aS'And I said this when I was campaigning, and over a four-year period, I signed 57 different bills into law, bills that we believe made a tremendous difference as it related to our energy portfolio going forward, but particularly relevant to tonights topic, made a significant difference in our ability to see economic development attached to clean energy.'
p160
aS'One of those bills was a renewable energy standard bill in the first 100 days that took us to a 20 percent standard by 2020 with a rate cap in place for consumers.'
p161
aS'In fact, last year, the utility and I, after talking with each other, said, you know what?'
p162
aS'We can get to 30 percent by 2020 with the same rate cap in place.'
p163
aS'So, as a state, weve got a 30 percent renewable energy standard.'
p164
aS'But in those 57 bills, we did Smart metering, meaning people who were residential and industrial consumers could actually get paid if they put energy back onto the grid.'
p165
aS'We did a variety of things to inspire the bill out of transmission, inspire new technology, energy efficiency.'
p166
aS'When we talk about clean energy, energy efficiency is one of the most significant things we as a country can do to move this country in a direction toward, in fact, a clean energy economy.'
p167
aS'So Im not going to go through the 57 bills, but what Ill tell you is the proof is in the pudding.'
p168
aS'We have significant economic development tied to that, and Ill give you just a couple of examples.'
p169
aS'Vestas wind turbines, the Danish company, building wind turbines in Colorado, made the announcement just after I made the -- signed the bill.'
p170
aS'That allowed us to go to a 20 percent by 2020, they in fact then have four factories since that theyve announced that, at the end of the day, its going to be 2,600 employees, a billion dollar investment.'
p171
aS'SMA, its a German company -- theyre manufacturing solar inverters in Colorado for the first time outside of Germany.'
p172
aS'We have home-grown companies, companies, again, where the technology was developed in a laboratory in Colorado we have, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory or one of our research universities, or even private laboratories.'
p173
aS'One of the thin-film photovoltaic technologies was developed in a Lockheed Martin laboratory, and so weve commercialized that and see these companies grow from the ground up.'
p174
aS'Weve seen all sorts of growth in this sector, even during a recession.'
p175
aS'And its not just Colorado.'
p176
aS'If you look around the country, in places in the Midwest, in the South, in the Southeast, in California, in the Northeast, here in New York, weve all sorts of investments in clean energy that is related to job growth.'
p177
aS"If you look at the last 10 years and if you look at Michigan for example where they've had terrible job loss."
p178
aS'In many of their conventional sectors, theyve seen job increases, a 5.7 percent increase in jobs in Michigan over the last decade.'
p179
aS'Colorado had an 18 percent increase and as John said were the fourth if you look at where we stand, we are fourth in terms of how we have clean tech workers as a state.'
p180
aS'Now in my last minute Im just going to tell you theres a reason for doing this thats beyond just the economic development.'
p181
aS'We have a powerful example in Colorado, powerful examples around the country that demonstrate economic development as a part of this.'
p182
aS'But therere a couple of other things that are very important too.'
p183
aS'When you build out a clean energy economy, you actually do something in a very significant way to address the environmental challenges that are upon us.'
p184
aS'Even if you dont believe that global warming is human caused there are still significant environmental challenges.'
p185
aS'They are a part of a carbon based energy production sector.'
p186
aS'And in addition to that you wind up addressing another very serious problem we have in this country which is energy security.'
p187
aS'Domestically produced energy does a variety of things including reducing our trade deficit and reducing it in such a way that we can look and say the health of the country is better going forward because we have proposed an agenda that relies upon domestically produced energy.'
p188
aS'Its the trifecta, right?'
p189
aS'It is about energy security, its about environmental security, and its about economic security.'

p275
aS'I thought thered be two of them, Ive already heard of the third one, already tonight.'
p276
aS'And second that it rests on a basic but surprisingly widespread economic fallacy that paying more for energy will somehow make us richer.'
p277
aS'There are a number of collateral arguments in our case which my partner, Robert Bryce, will explore further, such as the fact that most forms of so-called clean energy are inferior energy sources, ill suited to many of our needs.'
p278
aS'Now, the bait and switch comes in just two parts, Ill have to leave the third for later.'
p279
aS'Weve been told for the better part of the last two decades that we need to make a rapid transition to clean energy away from fossil fuels in order to stave off climate catastrophe.'
p280
aS'And all of the official assessments of the matter from the national and international bodies that have studied the matter such as the U.N.s IPCC concluded that the cost of doing so would be substantial.'

aS'But with the collapse of meaningful climate legislation here and abroad, and the arrival of the great recession, suddenly the argument for clean energy has been shifted into the form of tonights motion.'
p284
aS'Clean energy will make us richer, it is the path to prosperity itself.'
p285
aS'Happy days are here again.'
p286
aS'Its the new domain of free lunch economics, I call it three lumens.'
p287
aS'Now, the basic problem with so-called clean energy is that nearly every form of it is more expensive than the fossil fuel energy it seeks to displace.'
p288
aS'Now, I know of no economic theory that says the economy benefits by reducing the purchasing power of consumers.'
p289
aS'The case for this motion rests on the same fallacy as the retailer who loses money on each sale, but promises to make up for it with additional volume.'
p290
aS'The second bait and switch concerns what we mean by clean energy, because the working definition of clean energy seems to shift to make the term almost meaningless.'
p291
aS'Typically clean energy has meant purely renewable sources such as wind, solar, tidal energy and geothermal, along with environmentally neutral technologies like biomass and biofuels, though I could add that corn ethanol badly failed the test of environmental neutrality.'
p292
aS'And despite more than 30 years of strong emphasis on these sources they still account for less than five percent of our energy supply.'
p293
aS'But now suddenly were told that natural gas is a clean energy source that should be used to displace coal.'
p294
aS'But theres something very odd if were now counting a fossil fuel, a finite hydrocarbon, as a clean energy source.'
p295
aS'Do carbon dioxide emissions no longer matter in the definition of clean energy?'
p296
aS'Consider that climate policy orthodoxy says we need to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to one billion tons by the year 2050.'
p297
aS'Today right now, carbon dioxide emissions from current use of natural gas 1.2 billion times.'
p298
aS'Above the target for every source for the year 2050.'
p299
aS'This is why the Sierra Club, two weeks ago, changed its position and said we should now make it an object of national policy to phase out natural gas entirely by the year 2050.'
p300
aS'Their director of climate and energy told the Politico two weeks ago, quote, We want people to know that natural gas is not a clean fuel.'
p301
aS"Mark Brownstein, Environmental Defense Fund, told Politico, quote Simply because coal is awful doesn't mean natural gas gets to be terrible."
p302
aS'How is it that natural gas, which, as I say, produces over a billion tons of CO2, is clean energy, but nuclear power, which produces zero CO2 emissions, is usually considered not to be clean energy.'
p303
aS'Governor Ritter includes it as clean energy.'
p304
aS'The U.S. Congress specifically excluded it from Climate and Energy legislation the last two years.'
p305
aS'Moreover, if natural gas is clean energy, then guess what, so is oil.'
p306
aS'An awful lot of natural gas is produced in the production of oil, and oil has almost the same green house gas emissions per unit of energy produced as natural gas.'
p307
aS'And if you want to spend enough money, you can make coal clean.'
p308
aS'Governor Ritter used the same phrase President Obama likes to use: clean coal.'
p309
aS"And so you're left with the rest of the clean energy suite that cannot scale up without mandates and massive subsidies from taxpayers."
p310
aS'And even then, they still fail.'
p311
aS"In recent months, you've seen solar power-makers like Solyndra in California, and Evergreen Solar in Massachusetts, lay off a thousand employees, and cut about half their production capacity, despite receiving nearly a billion dollars in loan guarantees and subsidies from government."
p312
aS"And we've seen a number of bio-fuel companies fail despite mandates of lavish subsidies."
p313
aS'Now, the idea that clean energy will be the sector that leads us out of the recession is equally risible.'
p314
aS'There are a number of studies on this.'
p315
aS"I'll give you one quotation from a study from the Stanford University, a very highly-regarded energy modeling forum that concluded, quote, The advantages of increased jobs for renewable energy are vastly overstated at costs prevailing today."
p316
aS'They note that most energy investments produce between two and six jobs.'
p317
aS"That's true of conventional oil and coal, and natural gas, but also of renewable sources like windmills."
p318
aS"Well, of course, if you spend a million dollars on any sector of the economy, the Department of Commerce's models say you get about 9.7 new jobs."
p319
aS"That's why the energy modeling forum concluded, quote, Electricity generation across all sources creates far fewer jobs than other activities in the economy."
p320
aS"Subsidies to either green or conventional sources will detract, rather than expand economy's job base, because they will shift investments from other sectors that will create warms climates."
p321
aS"In other words, if you're looking for a sector to generate job growth, to lead us out of the recession, the energy sector, clean or otherwise, isn't it."
p322
aS"Now, I'll conclude with an observation on the essential absurdity of this motion."
p323
aS'If this motion were true, we would not need to debate it at all.'
p324
aS'Did we have to debate whether railroads, and automobiles, and the telegraph, and the telephone, would transform transportation and communication?'
p325
aS'Did we have to debate whether the technology revolution and the Internet would change our lives?'
p326
aS'And change American productivity?'
p327
aS'Did we, a hundred years ago, have to debate the motion that new oil, coal, and gas supplies will power the next generation of American industry?'
p328
aS'Of course not.'
p329
aS'And above all, did we ever need a mandate from the government, like a renewable portfolio standard, to get consumers to buy cars or desktop computers?'
p330
aS'The answer to that is fairly obvious.'
p331
aS'Clean energy, however defined, does not resemble any of the past histories of recession- busting forces.'
p332
aS'And the odd thing is, most recession-busting forces, like the housing sector in previous recessions, are because of this pent-up demand.'
p333
aS"There actually isn't a pent-up demand for new energy at the moment."
p334
aS'Energy consumption in America has fallen sharply as a result of the recession.'
p335
aS'Our energy consumption is down by the largest percentage amount since the end of World War II.'
p336
aS'So building new energy supplies right now makes about as much sense as building new tracts of suburban housing.'
p337
aS"And by the way, none of the ideas I've heard tonight, with the partial exception of electrified cars such as hybrids, do anything to affect the one part of the energy picture that bothers us the most, and that's our dependence on foreign oil."
p338
aS"Most of what you're going to hear tonight is about the electricity sector."
p339
aS'We can put a windmill on every single house in America, and put solar panels on every roof, and it will not reduce our oil imports at all.'
p340

p351
aS'I thought thered be two of them, Ive already heard ofthe third one, already tonight.'
p352
aS'And second that it rests on a basic but surprisinglywidespread economic fallacy that paying more for energy will somehow make us richer.There are a number of collateral arguments in our case which my partner, Robert Bryce,will explore further, such as the fact that most forms of so-called clean energy are inferiorenergy sources, ill suited to many of our needs.'

aS'Again, my name is Kassia Yanosek and I come to you tonight as an investor.'
p481
aS'Ive been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade, and I used to invest in dirty energy.'
p482
aS'My background includes investing at Bechtel Enterprises, the private equity arm of Bechtel which is a large engineering firm.'
p483
aS'I also worked at BP.'
p484
aS'So I started out my career investing in coal and gas.'
p485
aS'And, you know, as an investor, I look for the biggest growth markets.'
p486
aS'So thats why Im a clean energy investor right now.'
p487
aS'I dont sit in an ivory tower or a think tank.'
p488
aS'Instead, I often sit in airplane seats, travel around the country, roll up my sleeves, meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs, and I figure out where to create value in this economy, which is why were here tonight.'
p489
aS'And this is what were talking about tonight.'
p490
aS'You know, most recently, before starting my firm, I was a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm thats deployed millions of capital in the sector of clean energy.'
p491
aS'I currently invest with New York investment houses around the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies, and thats where I think the opportunities are in this market.'
p492
aS'So Im going to give you the real story tonight about why clean energy will drive our economic recovery.'
p493
aS'The other thing Id like to point out is that I actually dont think we should be having this debate -- not will it or wont it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive our economy.'
p494
aS'We need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where we write op-eds, stop resting on our laurels of the past, stop wimping out about how China is going to cream us.'
p495
aS'Is that any way to win a match or a race?'
p496
aS'So my goal tonight is to convince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that weve done in the past, and that clean energy is the next growth market for the U.S. And heres why clean energy can drive economic growth.'
p497
aS'Im going to give you three reasons.'
p498
aS'First of all, innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment, and Im going to provide some examples, from I.T.'
p499
aS'to the auto industry, and also why government has in the past, and it needs to continue to be, an integral part of this growth for the energy sector.'
p500
aS'Number two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.'
p501
aS'So, instead of complaining about China, lets start competing so we can sell into China.'
p502
aS'And then, third, we do need to talk about our dependence on oil.'
p503
aS'Oil does not help economic recovery.'
p504
aS'Our dependence on oil doesnt help economic recovery; it actually hinders economic recovery.'
p505
aS'So we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce our dependence on any one commodity, which smoothes out volatility and helps our economy grow.'
p506
aS'So, point number one: innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energy sector.'
p507
aS'You know, we can see this in our I.T.'
p508
aS'markets.'
p509
aS'We now lead the world in research, product, and deployment.'
p510
aS'And certainly, Silicon Valley has been a huge driving force of the U.S. economy.'
p511
aS'Right now, I believe that about 16 percent of our total exports are related to advanced technologies.'
p512
aS'Well, guess what?'
p513
aS'That wasnt part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago, so clean energy has a great future ahead of it if were going to actually put our heads together and start innovating.'
p514
aS'And government was a big part of that.'
p515
aS'DARPA which is an arm of the government was instrumental in the development of the Internet.'
p516
aS'And secondly, the auto industry -- dinosaur industry.'
p517
aS'You know, we got our pants beat off by Japan.'
p518
aS'But guess what?'
p519
aS'Detroit is turning around.'
p520
aS'Were starting to see Ford and Chevrolet start developing electric vehicles.'
p521
aS'Theres a lot of activity out there, and its winning accolades.'
p522
aS'So it really debunks this view that we cant afford to have this job creation in the United States.'
p523
aS'And then, finally, without going too much into the weeds, Ill point out some obvious statistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs.'
p524
aS'Last year, $243 billion was invested in clean energy globally.'
p525
aS'This is essentially a 25 percent compound average growth rate that weve seen over the past five years.'
p526
aS'And this is really one of the biggest drivers that were seeing in the markets today.'
p527
aS'In the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the United States while total jobs grew by only 3.7 percent.'
p528
aS'So I have a little bit of different perspective and some different statistics than my opponents over there.'
p529
aS'And then, finally, Ill point out that costs are coming down, count down the curve.'
p530
aS'Electric batteries cost about $1,000 a kilowatt hour two years ago; today its about half that, and were on track for some very competitive technology that were going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years.'
p531
aS'So were starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve.'
p532
aS'Point two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.'
p533
aS'Its important that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets.'
p534
aS'Its an opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.'
p535
aS'My opponent actually pointed out a very important point: There is not a whole lot of energy growth going on in the U.S. and in the next 10-20 years.'
p536
aS'Ninety percent of the growth and energy consumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries.'
p537
aS'So we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that were going to see in these export markets.'
p538
aS'So, finally, we need to learn from the information technology industry.'
p539
aS'We need to develop the energy economy the way we did the I.T.'
p540
aS'And were starting to do that.'
p541
aS'Clean tech really is where information technology was 30 years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago.'
p542
aS'So were at the beginning of a very long and prosperous future for this sector.'
p543
aS'And then, point three, we need a portfolio of energy choice.'
p544
aS'Dependence on fossil fuels doesnt help economic recovery.'
p545
aS'As I said, it actually hinders it.'
p546
aS'You know, were seeing $100 oil.'
p547
aS'Weve seen this happen before, and price spikes really do not help the economy.'
p548
aS'Rising energy prices act as a drag on GDP growth.'
p549
aS'A 10 percent oil shock is -- could actually lower GDP growth by .2 percent per year for the next two years, and thats a recent statistic that Goldman Sachs just put out.'
p550
aS'Were also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporate margins, impacts the consumers, so when we talk about the price of energy, I dont necessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energy economy in keeping costs down for consumers.'
p551
aS'So, essentially, with that, Im going to close with bringing you back to the focus of this debate, which is that clean energy can drive the future of our economy.'
p552
aS'And, frankly, if youre not for the clean energy economy, then youre not for economic recovery.'

aS'Again, my name is Kassia Yanosek and I come to you tonight as an investor.Ive been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade, and I used to invest in dirtyenergy.My background includes investing at Bechtel Enterprises, the private equity arm ofBechtel which is a large engineering firm.'
p565
aS'I also worked at BP.'
p566
aS'So I started out mycareer investing in coal and gas.'
p567
aS'And, you know, as an investor, I look for the biggestgrowth markets.'
p568
aS'So thats why Im a clean energy investor right now.'
p569
aS'I dont sit in anivory tower or a think tank.'
p570
aS'Instead, I often sit in airplane seats, travel around thecountry, roll up my sleeves, meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs, and I figureout where to create value in this economy, which is why were here tonight.'
p571
aS'And this iswhat were talking about tonight.'
p572
aS'You know, most recently, before starting my firm, Iwas a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm thats deployed millions ofcapital in the sector of clean energy.'
p573
aS'I currently invest with New York investment housesaround the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies, and thats where I thinkthe opportunities are in this market.'
p574
aS'So Im going to give you the real story tonight aboutwhy clean energy will drive our economic recovery.The other thing Id like to point out is that I actually dont think we should be having thisdebate -- not will it or wont it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive oureconomy.'
p575
aS'We need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where wewrite op-eds, stop resting on our laurels of the past, stop wimping out about how China isgoing to cream us.'
p576
aS'Is that any way to win a match or a race?'
p577
aS'So my goal tonight is toconvince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that wevedone in the past, and that clean energy is the next growth market for the U.S.And heres why clean energy can drive economic growth.'
p578
aS'Im going to give you threereasons.'
p579
aS'First of all, innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment, andIm going to provide some examples, from I.T.'
p580
aS'to the auto industry, and also whygovernment has in the past, and it needs to continue to be, an integral part of this growthfor the energy sector.Number two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.'
p581
aS'So,instead of complaining about China, lets start competing so we can sell into China.'
p582
aS'Andthen, third, we do need to talk about our dependence on oil.'
p583
aS'Oil does not help economicrecovery.'
p584
aS'Our dependence on oil doesnt help economic recovery; it actually hinderseconomic recovery.'
p585
aS'So we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce ourdependence on any one commodity, which smoothes out volatility and helps oureconomy grow.So, point number one: innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energysector.'
p586
aS'You know, we can see this in our I.T.'
p587
aS'markets.'
p588
aS'We now lead the world inresearch, product, and deployment.'
p589
aS'And certainly, Silicon Valley has been a hugedriving force of the U.S. economy.'
p590
aS'Right now, I believe that about 16 percent of our totalexports are related to advanced technologies.'
p591
aS'Well, guess what?That wasnt part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago, so clean energy has a great futureahead of it if were going to actually put our heads together and start innovating.'
p592
aS'Andgovernment was a big part of that.'
p593
aS'DARPA which is an arm of the government wasinstrumental in the development of the Internet.And secondly, the auto industry -- dinosaur industry.'
p594
aS'You know, we got our pants beatoff by Japan.'
p595
aS'But guess what?'
p596
aS'Detroit is turning around.'
p597
aS'Were starting to see Ford andChevrolet start developing electric vehicles.'
p598
aS'Theres a lot of activity out there, and itswinning accolades.'
p599
aS'So it really debunks this view that we cant afford to have this jobcreation in the United States.And then, finally, without going too much into the weeds, Ill point out some obviousstatistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs.'
p600
aS'Last year, $243 billionwas invested in clean energy globally.'
p601
aS'This is essentially a 25 percent compound averagegrowth rate that weve seen over the past five years.'
p602
aS'And this is really one of the biggestdrivers that were seeing in the markets today.In the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the United States while total jobs grewby only 3.7 percent.'
p603
aS'So I have a little bit of different perspective and some differentstatistics than my opponents over there.'
p604
aS'And then, finally, Ill point out that costs arecoming down, count down the curve.'
p605
aS'Electric batteries cost about $1,000 a kilowatt hourtwo years ago; today its about half that, and were on track for some very competitivetechnology that were going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years.'
p606
aS'Sowere starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve.Point two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.'
p607
aS'Itsimportant that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets.'
p608
aS'Itsan opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.'
p609
aS'My opponent actuallypointed out a very important point: There is not a whole lot of energy growth going on inthe U.S. and in the next 10-20 years.'
p610
aS'Ninety percent of the growth and energyconsumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries.So we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that were going tosee in these export markets.'
p611
aS'So, finally, we need to learn from the informationtechnology industry.'
p612
aS'We need to develop the energy economy the way we did the I.T.And were starting to do that.'
p613
aS'Clean tech really is where information technology was 30years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago.'
p614
aS'So were at the beginning of a very longand prosperous future for this sector.'
p615
aS'And then, point three, we need a portfolio ofenergy choice.'
p616
aS'Dependence on fossil fuels doesnt help economic recovery.'
p617
aS'As I said, itactually hinders it.'
p618
aS'You know, were seeing $100 oil.'
p619
aS'Weve seen this happen before,and price spikes really do not help the economy.'
p620
aS'Rising energy prices act as a drag onGDP growth.'
p621
aS'A 10 percent oil shock is -- could actually lower GDP growth by .2 percentper year for the next two years, and thats a recent statistic that Goldman Sachs just putout.Were also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporatemargins, impacts the consumers, so when we talk about the price of energy, I dontnecessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energyeconomy in keeping costs down for consumers.'

p698
aS'If you remember, the Waxman-Markey Bill in 2009 was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act.'

p700

aS'Im also ardently pro-nuclear.'
p702
aS'N to N, natural gas to nuclear -- I believe these are the paths to the future for a number of reasons.'

p708
aS'Wind energy is often viewed as the political darling of the moment.'
p709
aS'This is the clean energy source of the future.'
p710
aS'Well, if you saw WGBH just yesterday they had a story about Falmouth, Massachusetts, in which they talked about the objections and, in fact, the strenuous protest by local residents against a new wind turbine in that town.'
p711
aS'I can point you to localities all over the world.'
p712
aS'I have interviewed people in New Zealand, Australia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Missouri, Wisconsin, New York, some very heated debates here in New York State over the sighting of industrial wind turbines.'
p713
aS'What is the problem?'
p714
aS'Infrasound, low level noise that is driving people out of their homes.'
p715
aS'The wind energy industry says, Oh, well, these people that are complaining just need psychological counseling.'
p716
aS'" I kid you not.'
p717
aS'This is a serious problem that they cannot solve and they try to dismiss it out of hand, it cannot be resolved.'
p718
aS'My opponent said that natural gas or rather that fossil fuels cant possibly lead to any kind of economic recovery, I completely disagree.'
p719
aS'Natural gas today is selling for less than $4, why?'
p720
aS'Because of a tremendous technological innovation in the upstream oil and gas business.'
p721
aS"It's selling for about $4 per million BTUs, thats a reduction of about $3 per MMBTU compared to just three years ago."
p722
aS'That reduction in price is one of the rare bright spots in the commodity markets in the U.S.'
p723
aS'It is now saving American consumers $65 billion per year or $180 million per day, and thats a minimum number.'
p724
aS'The reality is clean energy is such a nebulous phrase it cannot possibly be supported because the phrase doesnt mean anything, therefore, you must vote against.'
p725
aS'Second point, green jobs do not exist or are so expensive as to be crippling to the economy.'
p726
aS'If youd believe the corn ethanol scammers, one of the longest running robberies of taxpayers in this countrys history, they just put out a report last month that said theyre -- they support 70,000 jobs.'
p727
aS'Well, if you believe the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the total taxpayer cost of the corn ethanol scam is over $16 billion.'
p728
aS'That works out to $230,000 per job.'
p729
aS'What about the wind industry?'
p730
aS'We hear this continually from the American Wind -- Energy Association, "Oh, were creating all kinds of manufacturing jobs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.'
p731
aS'" Texas Comptroller Public Accounts Susan Colmes just came out with a report in December, estimated that every wind job in Texas, where I live, Texas leads the country in new -- in wind generation capacity, 10,000 megawatts, each job associated with the wind industry costs $1.6 million to the taxpayers.'
p732
aS'Third point, clean energy cannot possibly drive Americas economic recovery because it is simply too small in scale.'
p733
aS'I pride myself on doing my research, doing my numbers, here they are.'
p734
aS'Every day coal provides about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent to the U.S. economy.'
p735
aS'Natural gas provides about 12 million barrels of oil equivalent every day to the U.S. economy.'
p736
aS'We also use roughly 17 million barrels of oil.'
p737
aS'So roughly 39 million barrels of oil equivalent from those three hydrocarbons, that dirty, nasty energy that nobody likes but everybody uses.'
p738
aS'Okay, so what about the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy sources that weve been discussing here?'
p739
aS'Non-hydro sources because we cant build any more dams here, geothermal, wind, biomass, and solar.'
p740
aS'In 2010, according to the EIA they provided 166 million megawatt hours of electricity to the U.S. That works out to277,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.'
p741
aS'So how does that compare then?'
p742
aS'If we just look at the two dirty, nasty sources of energy, oil and coal, they provide 100 times as much energy to the U.S. economy as the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy darlings of the moment.'
p743
aS'And if we include natural gas, which I believe is clean incredibly pro-natural gas, the ratio is 140 times as much energy from the three hydrocarbons as we get from the clean energy sources.'
p744
aS'We could double, triple, quadruple, quintuple the amount of energy that were getting from the clean energy sources that were discussing here, it will be so small as to make no difference to the U.S. economy, and it certainly will not drive Americas economic recovery, therefore, you must vote against the motion.'
p745
aS'Final point, clean energy cannot fuel Americas economic recovery because it is simply too expensive.'
p746
aS'Latest data from the Energy Information Administration estimate that over the next five years or so, gas fired electricity will cost about $63 per megawatt hour, onshore wind will cost about 50 percent more than that, offshore wind, four times as much as that, and solar thermal generated electricity, five times as much as that.'
p747
aS"In January, The Los Angeles Times reported on the city of Los Angeles' goal of having 33 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2020."
p748
aS'I quote from The Times, that, this push for renewables could result in electricity rate hikes of five to eight percent in each of the next five years.'
p749
aS"What's happening now, the city of Los Angeles is quietly rolling back the renewable targets."
p750
aS"In the governor's, Governor Ritter's home state, electricity rates have increased by 21 percent over the past six years, and the Denver Post just reported they are likely to increase by 20 percent over the next six."
p751
aS'Over the last six years, the increase has been twice the rate of inflation.'
p752
aS"The reality is that oil price spikes hurt the U.S. economy, there's no question about that."
p753
aS'With the coming rate, electricity rate hikes that will come from these renewable portfolio standards in the electricity markets, will be even worse for the economic recovery.'
p754
aS'You must vote against the motion.'
