p202
aS'All of them pose various types ofthreat to the Internet as we know it, but if we reduce all of these threats to the catch-all ofcyber war, I am concerned that it will take our country in a direction that we will verymuch regret.'
p203
aS'But tonight we are not only going to try to persuade you that the threat ofcyber war has in fact been grossly exaggerated, we are going to try to explain to you whythis has happened.'
p204
aS'In fact, what you are hearing now about the threat of cyber war is partof a long running campaign here in Washington to move control of the Internet, thetechnical standards and the openness that we have enjoyed away from its current modelto one that would give the intelligence community and the National Security Agencymuch greater authority to decide what people may or may not do on the Internet.'
p205
aS'Andthat effort has been underway long before the stories that you will hear tonight aboutRussian hackers and Chinese plans to take over the Internet and even attacks launchedfrom North Korea.'
p206
aS'Back in the 1970s, the NSA worried about the public availability ofencryption; the key security standard that today makes possible the routine transactionsyou engage in when you buy a book on Amazon or download a song from iTunes.'
p207
aS"NSAdidn't want that encryption technology widely available, and they fought against it.Fortunately, computer researchers pressed on, and encryption became widely availableand provided a key technique to make possible secure online transactions.But then, in the 1980s, along came John Poindexter who would later come up with TotalInformation Awareness, and he worried about unsecured private computer networks --does any of this sound familiar -- back in 1984."
p208
aS'And he wanted the National SecurityAgency to be responsible for computer security in the United States.'
p209
aS"Fortunately, theCongress didn't like that idea."
p210
aS'They pressed back on Mr. Poindexter and the WhiteHouse, and we established open standards to safeguard network security, but this is not200 N. Glebe Rd., #710the end of the story.'
p211
aS'Because then again in the early 1990s, as encryption was becomingmore widely available and the NSA worried that they could not intercept privatecommunications, they said to Internet users and American business, "You have to use anew technology that we\'ve developed, called Clipper, the escrow key encryptionstandard.'
p212
aS'Anytime you want to send a private e-mail, we need a copy of that key that youused to encrypt your communication because we want to be able to know what iscontained in your private messages.'
p213
aS'" And again, Congress pushed back and Internet userspushed back, and the Clipper chip proposal put forward by the NSA in the early 1990swas rejected.'
p214
aS'The story continues.'
p215
aS'After 9-11, NSA was there again arguing for controlof the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks.'
p216
aS"Now, don'tmisunderstand our argument tonight."
p217
aS'We are aware of these threats, and we are not goingto try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and thatwe should ignore.'
p218
aS'That is not our argument.'
p219
aS'Our argument is that we have to be verycareful about allowing a single, secret, unaccountable government agency, which hasbeen fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security, to become the dominantauthority for the Internet, which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that thethreat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated.So, we urge you this evening not only to side with our side, to agree that this threat hasbeen exaggerated, but also to understand why it has been exaggerated.'

aS'After 9-11, NSA was there again arguing for control of the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks.'
p260
aS"Now, don't misunderstand our argument tonight."
p261
aS'We are aware of these threats, and we are not going to try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and that we should ignore.'
p262
aS'That is not our argument.'
p263
aS'Our argument is that we have to be very careful about allowing a single, secret, unaccountable government agency, which has been fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security, to become the dominant authority for the Internet, which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that the threat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated.'
p264
aS'So, we urge you this evening not only to side with our side, to agree that this threat has been exaggerated, but also to understand why it has been exaggerated.'
p265
aS"There are agencies in Washington that want very much to know what's in your e-mail."
p266
aS'They want to know when you log online.'
p267
aS'They want to be able to build big databases and detect patters.'

p519
aS'And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choicequotes.'
p520
aS"Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of thisyear that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we're losing."
p521
aS'So, cyber waris going on right now in our country.'
p522
aS"Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber securityunder Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it'shappened so slowly that we don't see it."
p523
aS"So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead,billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn't notice it like the cyber warwe're currently losing."
p524
aS'In 2007, Germany -- and it\'s a great -- this is a great newspaperheadline -- "Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war.'
p525
aS'"This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them byyelling at them because China started a cyber war.'
p526
aS'Another headline, same incident:"China declares war on western search sites.'
p527
aS'" You can actually declare cyber war onsearch engines.'
p528
aS"I don't know if you knew that."
p529
aS'An article from an Australian magazine,The Independent, February of this year: "Hackers declare cyber war on Australia.'
p530
aS'" So,cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it.This year, London Times, March of this year: "Cyber war declared as China hunts for the [[laughter]] West\'s intelligence secrets.'
p531
aS'" And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was acyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place.'
p532
aS'I have one from the WallStreet Journal: "Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea.'
p533
aS'" In this instance, there were somedenial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States, whichhappen, we think, from North Korea.'
p534
aS'There were a bunch of congressmen actuallyproposing that we attack Korea in response, except we think the attacks might have comefrom the U.K., which would have been awkward, or, actually, from Florida, which wouldhave been really awkward.Okay, so this is silly, right?'
p535
aS"I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the [[laughter]] rhetoric, we're not talking about war."
p536
aS'This is a rhetorical war, right?'
p537
aS"It's the war ondrugs, it's the war on poverty."
p538
aS"It's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people'sattention, right, and to make an interesting headline."
p539
aS"Now, what's going on really is ablurring of the threats."
p540
aS'There are a lot of threats out there.'
p541
aS'Cyber war is one, cybercrime; weve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism.'
p542
aS'And itoften can be really hard to figure out whats happening.'
p543
aS'And just think about how werespond to these sorts of threats.200 N. Glebe Rd., #710When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the militaryor from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on whos attackingus and why.'
p544
aS'And when we dont know whos attacking us and why, it can be very easyto call it war.'
p545
aS'But in most cases, its not, right?'
p546
aS'Theres a lot -- and -- I took quick notes,I probably got them wrong, some of McConnells statements, some of the quotes about,that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risendramatically.'
p547
aS'Again, were hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there arevulnerabilities; cyber securitys a big deal, but theyre not war threats.'
p548
aS'Probably in thedebate later, were going to go into some of the examples of cyber war.'
p549
aS'I just mentionedKorea attacking the U.S. A big one was in Estonia; its been called the first cyber war.And basically, someone or some country, some believe its Russia, announced a denial ofservice attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so its kind of like the army marchesinto your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you cant get yourdrivers license renewed.'
p550
aS'Thats sort of what that looks like.'
p551
aS'The only person theyveever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn whowas annoyed about a statue falling down.'
p552
aS'So I mean, were now where we cant tellforeign invaders from bored kids.'
p553
aS'The other events we talk about, China was mentioneda little bit.'
p554
aS'I mean yes, theres a huge intelligence threat.'
p555
aS'Chinas doing a lot of targetingagainst Google, against others.'
p556
aS'Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per dayagainst government networks.'
p557

aS'The last article I saw said theres about$400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war.'

p569
aS'But, it really is.'
p570
aS'The threats are real; the threats are serious;cyber space is not a safe place, but these are not war threats.'

S"So, we're here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly exaggerated."
p580
aS'And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choice quotes.'
p581
aS"Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we're losing."
p582
aS'So, cyber war is going on right now in our country.'
p583
aS"Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber security under Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it's happened so slowly that we don't see it."
p584
aS"So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead, billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn't notice it like the cyber war we're currently losing."
p585
aS'In 2007, Germany -- and it\'s a great -- this is a great newspaper headline -- "Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war.'
p586
aS'" This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them by yelling at them because China started a cyber war.'
p587
aS'Another headline, same incident: "China declares war on western search sites.'
p588
aS'" You can actually declare cyber war on search engines.'
p589
aS"I don't know if you knew that."
p590
aS'An article from an Australian magazine, The Independent, February of this year: "Hackers declare cyber war on Australia.'
p591
aS'" So, cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it.'
p592
aS'This year, London Times, March of this year: "Cyber war declared as China hunts for the West\'s intelligence secrets.'
p593
aS'" And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was a cyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place.'
p594
aS'I have one from the Wall Street Journal: "Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea.'
p595
aS'" In this instance, there were some denial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States, which happen, we think, from North Korea.'
p596
aS'There were a bunch of congressmen actually proposing that we attack Korea in response, except we think the attacks might have come from the U.K., which would have been awkward, or, actually, from Florida, which would have been really awkward.'
p597
aS'Okay, so this is silly, right?'
p598
aS"I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the rhetoric, we're not talking about war."
p599
aS'This is a rhetorical war, right?'
p600
aS"It's the war on drugs, it's the war on poverty."
p601
aS"It's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people's attention, right, and to make an interesting headline."
p602
aS"Now, what's going on really is a blurring of the threats."
p603
aS'There are a lot of threats out there.'
p604
aS'Cyber war is one, cyber crime; weve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism.'
p605
aS'And it often can be really hard to figure out whats happening.'
p606
aS'And just think about how we respond to these sorts of threats.'
p607
aS'200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the military or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on whos attacking us and why.'
p608
aS'And when we dont know whos attacking us and why, it can be very easy to call it war.'
p609
aS'But in most cases, its not, right?'
p610
aS'Theres a lot -- and -- I took quick notes, I probably got them wrong, some of McConnells statements, some of the quotes about, that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risen dramatically.'
p611
aS'Again, were hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there are vulnerabilities; cyber securitys a big deal, but theyre not war threats.'
p612
aS'Probably in the debate later, were going to go into some of the examples of cyber war.'
p613
aS'I just mentioned Korea attacking the U.S. A big one was in Estonia; its been called the first cyber war.'
p614
aS'And basically, someone or some country, some believe its Russia, announced a denial of service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so its kind of like the army marches into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you cant get your drivers license renewed.'
p615
aS'Thats sort of what that looks like.'
p616
aS'The only person theyve ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who was annoyed about a statue falling down.'
p617
aS'So I mean, were now where we cant tell foreign invaders from bored kids.'
p618
aS'The other events we talk about, China was mentioned a little bit.'
p619
aS'I mean yes, theres a huge intelligence threat.'
p620
aS'Chinas doing a lot of targeting against Google, against others.'
p621
aS'Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day against government networks.'
p622
aS'That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your computers as well.'
p623
aS'Were talking about different worms and viruses; lots of threats, again not cyber war.'
p624
aS'So, I urge you to really think critically about what were talking about.'
p625
aS'Metaphors matter.'
p626
aS'If we frame this discussion as a war discussion, then what you do when theres a threat of war is you call in the military and you get military solutions.'
p627
aS'You get lockdown; you get an enemy that needs to be subdued.'

p694
aS'You can applaud or send me some cyber mail, and I will send you a reply.'

p696
aS'"Oh, we\'re not saying the system works.'
p697
aS"In fact, we agreeit's utterly vulnerable."
p698

aS'"Well, fine.'
p700
aS'We have to argue against that, but let us be truth-tellers about the state ofvulnerability in our networks and our endpoints, and then deal with it from there, neitherexaggerating nor understating it.So, what kind of threat am I talking about?'
p701
aS'Let me just give you two quick examples.The network itself.'
p702
aS'The Internet is an utterly bizarre network, and to answer yourquestion, John, the more I study it, the more I am just agog that it functions at all.'
p703
aS"Andthere are plenty of Internet engineers who ---- remain puzzled and say, well, it's just a pilot project."
p704
aS"The jury's still out."
p705
aS"[[Applause]] So, for example, to get a piece of data from one end to another, like this pen up to the [[Laughter]] back of the room, the sane, rational way to do it would be to hire somebody, to have aNewseum employee who would take it up there, and then if it didn't get there, we would200 N. Glebe Rd., #710know whom to blame."
p706
aS'Call it the FedEx method of getting it there.'
p707
aS'The way the Internetdoes it is basically like a big bucket brigade.'
p708
aS"I pass it to the front row, it goes back,would you mind, would you mind, or for sports fans, kind of like beer at a Red Sox game,right?You gain nothing except soiled trousers by doing it, but there is a strong normative [[Laughter]] presumption that you will pass the beer.Now, this also leads to structural vulnerability, because if you drink the beer or if you [[Applause]] pass it forward instead of sideways, it doesn't get to where it's going."
p709
aS'And it turns outthat in 2008, the state of Pakistan, as is its wont, asked its Internet service providers toprevent people in Pakistan from getting the YouTube.'
p710
aS"There was something there thatthey didn't like."
p711
aS'And one ISP, as kind of a parlor trick, chose to implement that block byannouncing within the stands of fans that are ISPs here, that it, in fact, was YouTube.And this is a decentralized system.'
p712
aS'So, its announcement meant that packets that wouldotherwise be going to YouTube went to them from their subscribers.'
p713
aS"And then itresonated like ripples in a pond from one ISP to another like dominoes until with abouttwo minutes, anywhere in the world, if you were trying to get to YouTube, your packetswere going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back."
p714
aS'Now, that is not only downrightweird, it is an example of just a whole genus of vulnerabilities that are extremely difficultto fix.Now, was that an act of war?'
p715
aS'Definitely not.'
p716
aS'Is it a vulnerability such that if you hadmalice towards a state that relies asymmetrically on this network and decided that youwanted to use this as an instrument of your aggression, could you do so?'
p717
aS'Absolutely, andI do not believe you will hear them say otherwise.'
p718
aS'That\'s why you hear Bruce sayingagainst the straw people of "there\'s a cyber war already in progress.'
p719
aS'" All right, I don\'tthink there\'s a cyber war going on right now against us in America, but boy are thevulnerabilities there.'
p720
aS"So long as there is the vulnerability, all we need is the motivation,and I don't want to rest on the good graces of any state around the world, or for thatmatter any 12-year-old, that wants to try to take down the net."
p721
aS'And, he\'s not 12, but I didask Ed Felten, computer scientist at Princeton, once, I said, "You know, if you\'re in a 24-like scenario and your life depended on it, and you had to bring down huge swathes of thenet and you only had a week to do it, kind of planting the seeds in the head I said couldyou do it.'
p722
aS'And he thought about it really careful, and he said, could I have two weeks?And thats the kind of thing that did not make me feel better.'
p723
aS'Now, Robert Rosencranz,one of our hosts, mentioned GhostNet, our collaborators in the Open Net initiative atToronto and up at Harvard, worked to expose this network that they named GhostNet200 N. Glebe Rd., #710where basically this wasnt run of the mill Trojans that all of us have right now on ourmachines while we think were playing solitaire and in fact our machines are spammingeach other.'

p725
aS'They can surveil everything; they can control the machine.'
p726
aS'Howdo we know?'
p727
aS'Because our researchers hacked that system and then could see what theysaw.'
p728
aS'We saw the ministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, thePhilippines, and Brunei, open to us, if all we wanted to do was grab the files.The embassies of Germany, Romania, Cyprus, the Associated Press, not the embassy, theAssociated Press itself, and NATO headquarters, exposed through our view of thissystem.'
p729
aS'Thats something that says to me, to the extent that surveillance and spy craft isan instrument of war, war is what you have.'

aS'So I am concerned as, is I think everybodyhere about protecting civil liberties, about not having the responses to this problem be tooquick, too panicked, too corporate, or too military.'
