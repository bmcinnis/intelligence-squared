aS'I think the message has been clear over the last 15 or 16 months that its a darn good time to be an adversary of America and its a pretty crummy time to be a friend and historic ally of America.'
p294
aS'And the moment our historic alliances and friendships believe that that they cannot count on America and its fidelity to the principles of Truman and Acheson, America truly will be in decline.'

p321

p322
aS'And Im very honoredto be here with Dan and with Mort and with Bernard.'
p323
aS'And thank you very much formoderating and thanks to all of you for being here.'
p324

p325
aS'And I think my [[applause]] concerns at the time were warranted.'
p326
aS'I knew that going into the war in Iraq was amistake.'
p327
aS'So did Barack Obama.'
p328
aS'We couldnt stop the administration from going in.'
p329
aS'Itestified in front of Congress.'
p330
aS'I warned -- of course we knew our armed forces weregoing to do great.'
p331
aS'Why not?'
p332
aS'Weve been practicing and building for it for years andyears and years.'
p333
aS'Its the war that everyone expected to fight.'
p334
aS'It was like, why is it takingus so long?'
p335
aS'So we went in there and just as we expected in three weeks or less, we werein Baghdad and Baghdad fell and that was the end of it and the troubles began.'
p336
aS'The truthis, when were talking about American foreign policy, it didnt begin on the 21st ofJanuary, 2009.'
p337
aS'And so I want to establish three things tonight.'
p338
aS'First, that Barack Obamabegan in a deep hole.'
p339
aS'And the first rule of when youre in a deep hole is stop digging andstart getting out of it.'
p340
aS'The second thing is I think hes doing a lot of things right, andthird I want to address some of the things that Dan brought up here.'
p341
aS'So first of all, thedeep hole.'
p342
aS'I dont think theres been any period in American foreign policy and domesticpolicy where weve seen so many crises and difficulties.'
p343
aS'It started with 9/11 when theadministration basically ignored the experience of the Clinton administration, didnt payenough attention to terrorism and we got clobbered.'
p344
aS'It then went into a war inAfghanistan that didnt target the correct enemy, that was just a scattering of bombs.Osama bin Laden was there; the military was never told to get him and he went toPakistan.'
p345
aS'Then we withdrew our intelligence assets; we prepared to go to war with Iraqwhich for a variety of reasons that have never been fully explained, the administrationwas insistent on doing.'
p346
aS'That easy victory turned into a drawn-out, very expensive, verydifficult insurgency.'
p347
aS'In the process, we lost friends and allies as they all fell by thewayside except for a couple of great allies like Britain and Italy.'
p348
aS'But the Europeansrightly had questions about how necessary this war was.'
p349
aS'We were no more in the deepinsurgency then Katrina came and Hugo Chavez and others had to offer assistance to theUnited States because we couldnt seem to take care of our own problems in Katrina.And then followed up by the financial collapse of 2007, 2008 which really put us in ahole as a nation that was in decline.'
p350
aS'So Barack Obama had a very tough road to hoe.'
p351
aS'Ithink hes doing a lot of things right.'
p352
aS'Hes starting by trying to make more friends andfewer enemies in the world, so hes reached out a hand of friendship to the Islamic world.His speech in Cairo was incredibly well received.'
p353
aS'He was nominated and received aNobel Peace Prize based on the atmosphere he projected and that atmosphere goes a longway in international relations.'
p354
aS"He's kept our military strong."
p355
aS'He has doubled down inAfghanistan.'
p356
aS"He's made it clear that there will be no easy path for terrorists in the UnitedStates."
p357
aS'He stayed very tough on homeland security.'
p358
aS'He stuck with the commitmentsAmerica made in Iraq.'
p359
aS"He's got a team in the Pentagon and elsewhere that will followthrough on the effective policies of the previous administration and modify them wherenecessary."
p360
aS"So I think he's doing a lot of things right in terms of keeping us safe."
p361
aS"I thinkin terms of his work with NATO, they've made very strong presentations at the NATOsummit."
p362
aS"We brought in new members in NATO, Albania and Croatia, helping to fill outthe Balkans and bring stability into that region.And we've worked on other areas like trying to open up Burma."
p363
aS"He's broadened thedialogue so that when we go to the Asia Pacific economic groups and OCEON and talkover there, we're not just talking about pursuing terrorists."
p364
aS"We're talking about all theother things that are important for us."
p365
aS"And he's taken a major role in internationaleconomic affairs."
p366
aS'And really, there is nothing more important for America at this pointafter you keep America safe than to rebuild this economy and to work with our friendsand allies around the world to do that.'
p367
aS"And he's doing all of that."
p368
aS"As far as Iran isconcerned, and here I want to turn to the third point, let's talk about Iran."
p369
aS'Because ofgoing into Iraq, the Bush administration was never able to bring moral force orintelligence to bear on Iran.'
p370
aS"In fact, there was an erroneous intelligence report in 2007that said they'd given up their nuclear program."
p371
aS"So let's give the president time to sort ofget traction in world affairs."
p372
aS"He's had it."
p373
aS"He's brought consensus to bear in the UnitedNations that Iran is not complying."
p374
aS'All options are on the table.'
p375
aS'That chapter is not overby a long shot, I would predict.'
p376
aS'As far as missile defense is concerned, there is a betterway to do it.'
p377
aS"That's a missile defense that we have right now on our navy ships that canintercept mid course."
p378
aS"We may need to go back to Europe at a later time when Iraniansdeploy an inner continental ballistic missile, but they're a long way from having it rightnow."
p379
aS'Inside Eastern Europe, the policy of putting the missile interceptors and the radarson the ground had adherence.'
p380
aS'It also had opponents.'
p381
aS'And what Barack Obama has doneis focused on the essential element which is the rationale for putting those interceptors inplace and the radar in place.'
p382
aS'That was to deter and reassure vis-a-vis Iran.'
p383
aS"And that'sexactly what the policy he announced will do.Our Navy can do those intercepts."
p384
aS'We do have that capability.'
p385
aS'It will be -- much moreeffective against Iran than the system that was being placed in the Czech Republic andPoland.'
p386
aS"I can't comment on what President Sarkozy said about Barack Obama's naivety.I'll leave those kinds of personal comments aside."
p387
aS"But I think what you do have in thepresident is a man who is experienced in the world, a man who looks at the other side aswell as what his own feelings are, someone who's running a pragmatic non-ideologicalpolicy, someone who's shown he's tough."
p388
aS"He's hard headed."
p389
aS"He means what he says.He's going to take America and lead us forward."
p390
aS"I think you have to vote no to the ideathat President Barack Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline."

p513
aS"He wasn't GeorgeBush."
p514
aS"The expectations --No, I don't mean that."
p515
aS'I think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of [[applause]] American leadership at that point.'
p516
aS'And the expectations about President Obama wereexceedingly high.'
p517
aS'Now, any president of the United States really inherits a great legacy.We stand at the top of the power ladder.'
p518
aS"We are not a dominant power but we're theleading power."
p519
aS"We're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations.Most countries distrust the United States less than they distrust one another."
p520
aS'So they lookfor Washington -- to Washington for leadership.'
p521

p522
aS'They know they cannot solvemost of these problems without the United States.'
p523
aS'And they need our leadership in themost severe and serious way.'
p524
aS'Now, my sense, however, is that President Obama on thislevel is uncomfortable with this role for the United States.'
p525
aS'He seems to be uncomfortablein leading a lot of other nations.'
p526
aS"And almost feels that there is nothing special aboutAmerica's role in the world."
p527
aS'What you have, it seems to me, is too much well intentionedbelief in the power of rhetoric, good will, and too little appreciation of reality.'
p528
aS'Theformer president of the Council of Foreign Relations, Les Gelb put it, there is theimpression that Obama confuses speeches with policies.Now, foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personalpolitical circumstances of those we are dealing with.'
p529
aS'And this is where I think we have areal problem.'
p530
aS'Because there is, I think, a critical mass of influential people in worldaffairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether ornot they have misjudged the man.'
p531
aS'In the Middle East they always talk about thefollowing.'
p532
aS'There are two chess games that are always being played in the Middle East.One is the chess board that you see on top of the table.'
p533
aS'The other is the chess board thatis below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game.And the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play thegame and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is reallyan erosion of confidence in the United States and limitation therefore on what we canaccomplish.'
p534
aS"And it also has contributed to a growing perception that Obama'smanagement of American power is almost amateurish."
p535
aS'He tends to speak as a teacherrather than as a leader.'
p536
aS'Now, in meetings with many of the leaders of the Arab world,particularly the Sunni leaders, they fear an expansionist Iran proceeding with full speedahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediaterange missiles.'
p537
aS'I will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an Arabcountry put it to me.'
p538
aS'When you remember Obama said if people extend a hand to shakeour hands instead of a fist, we will shake that hand.'
p539
aS"He says the problem with Iran is youcan't deal with it by shaking their hand."
p540
aS'You have to deal with them by showing thatyour capable of exercising the fist.'
p541
aS'And that is what -- it is that understanding and thatunderstanding of the culture, not just in the Middle East, but in many parts of the worldthat is missing.'
p542
aS"And what you have, you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in Iraq.And there is no sense, for example, when they had the uprising on the streets of Iran, thatwe were there with them, that we were on, as Fouad Ajami put it, on freedom's side.Now, the question is, is Iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience asAmerican weakness and the lack of real willpower?"
p543
aS'Well, as long as the Arab foreign --the Arab foreign ministers put it the following one.'
p544
aS'One of them said -- now, this is aquote.'
p545
aS'He said they are hopelessly naive.'
p546
aS'The Americans are hopelessly naive.'
p547
aS'Andthey -- in that part of the world, naivety is not just naivety.'
p548
aS'It is seen as weakness as itreally gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders aremade of.'
p549
aS'And that is the feeling that they have about America these days.'
p550
aS'Now, this iswhat French President Sarkozy was referring to.'
p551
aS'In fairness to what we said.'
p552
aS"Obamabasically comes and gives a speech about wouldn't it be nice if the world did not have anynuclear weapons."
p553
aS'Yes, it would.'
p554
aS"He basically said this is almost an alternative universe.It's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth."
p555
aS'They cannot behe said and Sarkozy pointed out, that there are two countries he said, thats in the meetingin which the president was in the audience.'
p556
aS'He said there are two countries right in frontof us doing the exact opposite, referring of course to North Korea and Iran, an Iran thathad ignored five U.N. resolutions on this issue alone.'
p557
aS'In the later diplomatic push, vis-a-vis Iran and North Korea: that yielded nothing.'
p558
aS'Sarkozy said we are right to talk aboutthe future as the president was referring, but we also have to worry about the present andhere you have these two countries, members of the United Nations who are pursuingexactly the policies that we find inimical.'
p559
aS'Weve got to find some way to deal with thepresent he said and not with the future.'
p560
aS'In fact he pointed to the President -- looked at thePresident and said, this is not the real world that you are talking about; this is the virtualworld.Now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the United Nations in the audience andthe French President says to an American President, you have to admit that the world isupside down when the French President sounds much stronger than the American one.And this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here.'
p561
aS'Now, it is, I can add tothose things youve heard the references to when Obama withdrew the promises of ABMdefenses, two countries in Central Europe, perhaps thinking that he might appease Russiainto abrogating their patronage of Irans nuclear ambitions.'
p562
aS'Well frankly this hasobviously failed and now in Central Europe, there is a fear that the United States may nolonger be a reliable guarantor of their security.'

p571
aS'Let me just say when President Obama came into office, it was really a quiet sigh of relief around the world.'
p572
aS"He wasn't George Bush."
p573
aS"The expectations -- No, I don't mean that."
p574
aS'I think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of American leadership at that point.'
p575
aS'And the expectations about President Obama were exceedingly high.'
p576
aS'Now, any president of the United States really inherits a great legacy.'
p577
aS'We stand at the top of the power ladder.'
p578
aS"We are not a dominant power but we're the leading power."
p579
aS"We're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations."
p580
aS'Most countries distrust the United States less than they distrust one another.'
p581
aS'So they look for Washington -- to Washington for leadership.'
p582
aS'And they look for Washington to support them against regional opponents and other threats.'
p583
aS'They know they cannot solve most of these problems without the United States.'
p584
aS'And they need our leadership in the most severe and serious way.'
p585
aS'Now, my sense, however, is that President Obama on this level is uncomfortable with this role for the United States.'
p586
aS'He seems to be uncomfortable in leading a lot of other nations.'
p587
aS"And almost feels that there is nothing special about America's role in the world."
p588
aS'What you have, it seems to me, is too much well intentioned belief in the power of rhetoric, good will, and too little appreciation of reality.'
p589
aS'The former president of the Council of Foreign Relations, Les Gelb put it, there is the impression that Obama confuses speeches with policies.'
p590
aS'Now, foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personal political circumstances of those we are dealing with.'
p591
aS'And this is where I think we have a real problem.'
p592
aS'Because there is, I think, a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether or not they have misjudged the man.'
p593
aS'In the Middle East they always talk about the following.'
p594
aS'There are two chess games that are always being played in the Middle East.'
p595
aS'One is the chess board that you see on top of the table.'
p596
aS'The other is the chess board that is below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game.'
p597
aS'And the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play the game and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is really an erosion of confidence in the United States and limitation therefore on what we can accomplish.'
p598
aS"And it also has contributed to a growing perception that Obama's management of American power is almost amateurish."
p599
aS'He tends to speak as a teacher rather than as a leader.'
p600
aS'Now, in meetings with many of the leaders of the Arab world, particularly the Sunni leaders, they fear an expansionist Iran proceeding with full speed ahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediate range missiles.'
p601
aS'I will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an Arab country put it to me.'
p602
aS'When you remember Obama said if people extend a hand to shake our hands instead of a fist, we will shake that hand.'
p603
aS"He says the problem with Iran is you can't deal with it by shaking their hand."
p604
aS'You have to deal with them by showing that your capable of exercising the fist.'
p605
aS'And that is what -- it is that understanding and that understanding of the culture, not just in the Middle East, but in many parts of the world that is missing.'
p606
aS'And what you have, you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in Iraq.'
p607
aS"And there is no sense, for example, when they had the uprising on the streets of Iran, that we were there with them, that we were on, as Fouad Ajami put it, on freedom's side."
p608
aS'Now, the question is, is Iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience as American weakness and the lack of real willpower?'
p609
aS'Well, as long as the Arab foreign -- the Arab foreign ministers put it the following one.'
p610
aS'One of them said -- now, this is a quote.'
p611
aS'He said they are hopelessly naive.'
p612
aS'The Americans are hopelessly naive.'
p613
aS'And they -- in that part of the world, naivety is not just naivety.'
p614
aS'It is seen as weakness as it really gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders are made of.'
p615
aS'And that is the feeling that they have about America these days.'
p616
aS'Now, this is what French President Sarkozy was referring to.'
p617
aS'In fairness to what we said.'
p618
aS"Obama basically comes and gives a speech about wouldn't it be nice if the world did not have any nuclear weapons."
p619
aS'Yes, it would.'
p620
aS'He basically said this is almost an alternative universe.'
p621
aS"It's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth."
p622
aS'They cannot be he said and Sarkozy pointed out, that there are two countries he said, thats in the meeting in which the president was in the audience.'
p623
aS'He said there are two countries right in front of us doing the exact opposite, referring of course to North Korea and Iran, an Iran that had ignored five U.N. resolutions on this issue alone.'
p624
aS'In the later diplomatic push, vis-a- vis Iran and North Korea: that yielded nothing.'
p625
aS'Sarkozy said we are right to talk about the future as the president was referring, but we also have to worry about the present and here you have these two countries, members of the United Nations who are pursuing exactly the policies that we find inimical.'
p626
aS'Weve got to find some way to deal with the present he said and not with the future.'
p627
aS'In fact he pointed to the President -- looked at the President and said, this is not the real world that you are talking about; this is the virtual world.'
p628
aS'Now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the United Nations in the audience and the French President says to an American President, you have to admit that the world is upside down when the French President sounds much stronger than the American one.'
p629
aS'And this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here.'
p630
aS'Now, it is, I can add to those things youve heard the references to when Obama withdrew the promises of ABM defenses, two countries in Central Europe, perhaps thinking that he might appease Russia into abrogating their patronage of Irans nuclear ambitions.'
p631
aS'Well frankly this has obviously failed and now in Central Europe, there is a fear that the United States may no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security.'

p685
aS'Barack Obama, as did any of your last presidents, believes instrengths but he believes in strengths as the great strategies, as Sun Tzu, Machiavelli,holding the fire and not this zero degree of strengths which is just Jacksonian politics.The second thing which is meant when one speaks about Barack Obama spelling thedecline of America alludes to the fact that Obama would not be supportive enough to hisnatural allies and too much supportive for his enemies.I dont think so at all.'
p686

p687
aS'Foreignpolicy by definition speaks with enemies, speaks with ugly leaders, and in the respect ofthe natural alliance.'
p688
aS'I happen to be one of the Europeans who have had the chance tospeak with Barack Obama about Israel six years ago before he was even candidate.'
p689
aS'Myfeeling again from outside is that to say that Barack Obama would not be supportiveenough to the old natural allies of America is just untrue.'
p690

p695
aS'But this be put aside, it istrue the Barack Obama speaks, speaks a lot, but why does he speak so much?He speaks because he knows that foreign policy has changed its stage, that the new stage [[laughter]] of foreign policy has new actors.'
p696
aS'And especially one new actor: not only the ,not only Sarkozy, not only the big leader of the world or the little leaders of the world,but the public opinion.'
p697
aS'Barack Obama understood that to have a real foreign policysupposes to address directly the world public opinion, that it is the only chance to achievesome real results as he did, for example, with the speech of Cairo.'
p698
aS'The other criticismwhich is done to Barack Obama is to admit too easily the rise of new powers and thesubsequent diminution of the American influence: power of Russia, power of China, andso on.'
p699
aS'But again, who is really spelling the decline?'
p700
aS'Those who still believe in the worldof yesterday, frozen in old schemes, or those who try to understand the world which iscoming with a new lens, with new glasses, and trying to maintain the rank of America inthis new world?Barack Obama just knows that China is becoming a big power.'
p701
aS'He just knows that [[applause]] Russia is an actor de-freezing itself from the old Stalinist era.'
p702
aS'He knows that he has todeal with that and he does.And the last reproach which is done to him is about exceptionalism.'
p703
aS'I read that BarackObama is getting rid of this old American creed which is exceptionalism.'
