aS'Yes, the gas boom is doing more harm than good, but why?'
p412
aS'What isgoing on?'
p413
aS'Simply, the gas companies are rushing forward in the face of too manyunknowns and too little control.'
p414
aS'In essence, these companies are engaged in anuncontrolled experiment, which is resulting in extreme and, in some cases, permanentharm to people, communities, and the environment that cannot be compensated for byany possible benefits.What my partner, Deborah Goldberg, and I will be talking with you about tonight is whatthose harms are that are being faced across the country because of the natural gasboom: the health risks for individuals, the impacts to the environment, and the costs forlocal communities.'
p415
aS'And why, in the face of the unknown, in the face of the harms, gascompanies are so intent on rushing forward hoping to figure it out along the way.Well, what exactly is fracking?'
p416
aS'Deborah and I use the term fracking to refer to the entirecradle-to-grave process of natural gas extraction, from site preparation throughtransmission to end uses.'
p417
aS'The process begins with cutting access roads through theexisting landscape and stripping a site about the size of five football fields to serve as amulti-well pad.'
p418
aS'Then the drilling rig will arrive, along with thousands of truckloads ofequipment, water, sand, and chemicals that will be used to drill thousands of feet intothe ground and miles horizontally.This is followed by the actual fracturing of the well which involves repeatedly, for amonth or more, forcing two to eight million gallons of water and hundreds ofundisclosed chemicals underground, under pressure, to fracture the rock, allowing thegas to escape.'
p419
aS'Then something must be done with the large quantity of contaminatedwastewater, up to several million gallons per well, that will come back up along with themethane now released from the shale.'
p420
aS'If not properly handled, the methane may findits way into nearby drinking water wells.'
p421
aS'It may also be released into the air eitherintentionally or as a result of leaks.'
p422
aS"The methane gas that is captured is then processedand forced through gathering lines and into high pressure pipelines that will need to beconstructed from numerous wellheads for hundreds and thousands of miles to the placewhere the gas will be burned, permanently carving up the landscape and communitiesthat lie in between.To give you a clearer idea of how this fracking process is impacting people andcommunities, imagine that you'd go home tonight and find out that your next-doorneighbor has signed a lease with a gas drilling company without asking you."
p423
aS'What canyou expect from this industrial activity going on next door?'
p424
aS"Even though you didn'tchoose to lease, you will be exposed to the same risks of contamination to the wateryou drink and the air you breathe as your neighbor."
p425
aS'You will be subject to the samethreat of leaks and spills of the fracking wastewater, which contain known carcinogensand radioactive material.'
p426
aS'Fracking-related spills occur on average once every three daysin Colorado.'
p427
aS'Moreover, the industry has no safe disposal plans for this waste.'
p428
aS"Much of itis currently injected into underground wells, but this practice has been linked toearthquakes, and there's growing evidence that these wells are leaking."
p429
aS'The gas wellitself, and associated processing compression in storage tanks, will leak toxic and smog-forming air pollutants.The once pristine air in fracked parts of Wyoming is now worse than the air in LosAngeles because of this.'
p430
aS'The few studies we do have show increased risks of cancer andrespiratory diseases in gas land communities linked to these releases.Like your leasing neighbor, you will be unable to escape noise that can sound -- theconstant day and night truck traffic, estimated by New York State at 4,000 truck trips perwell.'
p431
aS'There will be 24/7 noise that can sound like a jet engine, and glaring lights all nightlong during the drilling and fracturing of the well over the next month or more.'
p432
aS'You willalso potentially have gas pipelines cross your property whether you agree to it or not,and you will be subject to the same increase in your taxes as your drilling neighbor whenyour town has to repair the road damage caused by the heavy truck traffic that comeswith fracking that will tear apart your rural and suburban streets, and when your townhas to meet the increased demands for community services from transient drill crews.Proponents argue that the economic benefits outweigh these risks so far.'
p433
aS"But what arethe supposed benefits of this industrial activity almost literally in your backyard, ordown the street from your children's pool?"
p434
aS'The economic benefits for you will belimited.'
p435
aS"There will be access to cheap natural gas at least for a little while, but it won'tlast for very long because the amount that can be forced out of the earth is limited andwill run out."
p436
aS"But even more important, it will not remain cheap, because the industrywill be doing everything it can to increase the price of gas, including exporting America'sgas to other countries where they can triple -- yes, triple the price -- on the U.S. markettoday."
p437
aS'The drilling will bring jobs, at least while the drill rigs are in town, but not verymany and not for long, and these gas industry jobs are some of the most life-threatening in the country.Oil and gas workers are seven times more likely to die on the job than the nationalaverage.'
p438
aS'And fracking can destroy businesses that could sustain local economies into thefuture after the fracking boom is over, like agriculture, recreation, and tourism.What is clear is that gas companies are not willing to wait.'
p439
aS'The natural gas boom ismoving forward as a large uncontrolled experiment with every individual, family, andcommunity who has not signed a lease being forced to participate without theirconsent.'
p440
aS'Whatever transitory benefits fracking may provide is outweighed by all of theharms that it currently brings.'
p441
aS'But even more important, there are some harms thatsimply cannot be compensated for.'
p442
aS'If you can no longer live in your home or continue towork your family farm, if you lose your health, the health of your child, if you lose yourlife as hundreds of oil and gas workers have.If you lose access to drinkable water or breathable air as individuals in communitiesacross the fracking states have, there is no good that can outweigh such harm.Until we have a much better understanding of the processes and the true risks, untilthere are mandatory rules in place to control these risks and eliminate the extremeharm, and until the industry actually follows those rules, the only defensible course ofaction is a cautious one.'

aS'As recently as 2009, 45 percent of the powergeneration in the country was coal, 23 percent was natural gas.'
p604
aS"Today, it's about evenlysplit.There is a rush to natural gas and away from coal."
p605
aS'This is a great thing for the country.Natural gas has half the CO2 emissions than coal, 90 -- coal has 90 times more sulfurdioxide, five times more nitrogen oxide.'
p606
aS'Coal is the dirtiest fuel we have.'
p607
aS"And so, iffacilities could switch to natural gas, it has the potential to transform the country.You know, in Europe, where they like to think of themselves as extremelyenvironmentally sensitive, their emissions are actually going up because they're buildingmore coal fire power plants."
p608
aS'In America, our emissions are flat and going slightly down,according to studies.'
p609
aS"And a large part of the reason is because we're having this rush tonatural gas.The same is also true of China, of Mexico, of Russia, and of a handful of other countriesthat are relying on other sources than gas."

p695
aS"We aren't here tonight to decide whether or not fracking is a gift or if it's a Trojan Horse."
p696
aS'We are here to decide whether or not the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good.'
p697
aS'So, what characterizes a boom?'
p698
aS"It's big."
p699
aS"It's sudden."
p700
aS'And it blows a lot of smoke.'
p701
aS'And the natural gas boom is doing all of that to an extreme.'
p702
aS"It's too much."
p703
aS"It's too fast."
p704
aS'And the hype is just over the top.'
p705
aS"So, why do I say that it's too much?"
p706
aS'The most serious health and environmental impacts of fracking are largely due to very intensive gas development.'
p707
aS'We have 500,000 gas wells in this country, nearly 3,000 in one county, 11 compressor stations belching carcinogenic air emissions in a tiny town of only two square miles.'
p708
aS'Our bodies and our ecosystems can absorb a certain amount of abuse and still bounce back.'
p709
aS"But at a certain point, it's just too much, and the insults overwhelm the resilience."
p710
aS'Take Pennsylvania, for example.'
p711
aS'In the beginning, Pennsylvania was letting the frackers take their wastewater, which is contaminated with very high levels of salt, to sewage treatment plants, where it was diluted with the sewage, and then discharged into rivers and streams.'
p712
aS'In short order we had a water quality violation in the drinking water supply for 350,000 people.'
p713
aS"And what's more, Pennsylvania realized that if they continued to let the frackers take that amount of wastage through its treatment plants, they would salinate every freshwater stream in the state in a period of two years."
p714
aS'The same dynamic operates on a global level.'
p715
aS'Our atmosphere can absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions.'
p716
aS'But if we release too much, the climate warms to a point of catastrophic change.'
p717
aS'And the natural gas boom is taking us to that tipping point, because the way that fracking is done now releases very large amounts of methane into the air.'
p718
aS'And methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, almost 72 times as potent as carbon dioxide, depending on the time frame that you look at.'
p719
aS"A recent study showed that the leakage from fracking is about four percent of production and the scientists recognized that at that level gas loses its entire climate advantage over coal when it's burned for electrical power."
p720
aS"The intensive development isn't really even good for the industry."
p721
aS"Right now the industry is losing money on every dry gas well that's drilled."
p722
aS"But it's even worse for solar, wind, and other clean energy sources, because they are displaced when the price of natural gas drops so low."
p723
aS"The boom is not only too big, but it's way too fast."
p724
aS'It is out ahead of the science.'
p725
aS"We do know as a result of lots of public pressure that some of the chemicals that are used in this process are toxic, but there are many chemicals that have never even been tested as to their toxicity, and we have no clue what they're going to do to our health or environment, in the short or the long term."
p726
aS"We don't know where the wastewater that stays down below -- and that can be as much as 90 percent of the waste water in the northeastern shale -- is going to migrate in 20, 30 years or more."
p727
aS'The development is also way ahead of the protections that we have.'
p728
aS"Instead of doing science and getting the safeguards before we move forward, we are flooring the accelerator and we're responding to crises."
p729
aS"When you move too fast you cut corners and you have accidents, and that's particularly troublesome when you're talking about climate change, because the single most important factor for the social and environmental impact of climate change is the speed at which it progresses."
p730
aS"We move too fast with climate change and we don't have time to prepare or to adapt, and so the climate scientists are telling us that we have to address the most potent greenhouse gases right now as fast as we can, and on that list is methane."
p731
aS'The hype and the hoopla is clouding our vision and making it impossible for us to hear the facts.'
p732
aS'There are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ensure that this industry can continue to operate without the science and without the protections we need.'
p733
aS'$320 million spent on lobbying the federal government in just two years.'
p734
aS"As a result, what we are hearing now is not how we're going to end our addiction to fossil fuels, but instead, a hundred years of gas."
p735
aS"Now, a hundred years of gas is based on extracting every molecule of gas from all of our reserves, even those that we haven't actually discovered yet, when it is well known that only about 10 percent of those reserves tend to be economically feasible to develop."
p736
aS'And if we switch our power plants over to gas and our transportation systems over to gas, and our heating and cooking systems, and then on top of that we export liquid natural gas to other countries, how long is that abundant resource going to last?'
p737
aS'And at what price to our health and environment?'
p738
aS'The boom mentality produces magical thinking.'
p739
aS'The idea that this industry is going voluntarily to abide by a golden rule or a golden age of gas is just a fairy tale.'
p740
aS"This industry fights every protection we try to put in place, federal and state, often when it's even in its economic interests to comply."
p741
aS'What all this means is that we are in the middle of an uncontrolled experiment.'
p742
aS'If we get this wrong, there is no turning back.'
p743
aS"And so we need to take the opportunity now when, we have a glut and we are not desperate for gas, to do the science and get the protections in place before it's too late and the natural gas boom that looks so exciting now goes bust in the face of the next generation."

p811
aS"Let me tell you why their position, that the costs of developingnatural gas are simply not worth the benefits, is wrong.First, what they didn't tell you is that there is absolutely nobody in the United States, noentity, that could actually introduce this proposition and make it so."
p812
aS'There are hundredsof millions of decision makers in our energy system.'
p813
aS"If we rely on a regulated market,consumers and suppliers all around the country, every one of you is making energychoices every day, they don't have the authority to completely stop this, no single statecould stop this, nor could the federal government."
p814
aS"On the consumer side, Americanstend not to think very much about energy.What they think about is getting to their job or getting to the shop where they hope tofind lots of options, whether they can power their computers, or keep their homeswarm or cool, and it's those realities that people don't think about energy that much.That makes this a really hard issue to deal with."
p815
aS'Everybody wants energy 24/7.'
p816
aS'Theywant it pretty cheap.'
p817
aS"Many say they'd like it to be clean, and many really suffer whenprices go up."
p818
aS"That's the reality, and that makes this issue very gray and not as black andwhite as my opponents would tell you.Deborah and Kate have set up in some sense a false dichotomy."
p819
aS'They make it seem asthough natural gas is evil and so everything else is pure.'
p820
aS"We know that that's not thecase."
p821
aS'Surely we should be developing more wind and solar power.'
p822
aS"I'm sure everyone inthis audience agrees with that."
p823
aS"Right now, seven percent of America's energy supplycomes from renewable energy; most of that is from the Roosevelt-era hydroelectricfacilities, those gigantic projects, none of which we would be able to build again forenvironmental impact reasons.The other major portion of renewables right now comes from biofuels such as ethanol,with its own problems from an environmental impact point of view."
p824
aS"Wind and solar areexpected to grow, but even if they're 10 times as much as they are today, we're stilltalking about a long way to go and a small portion of the supply, and I hope we getthere."
p825
aS"It's very hard.But these and every other energy choice are really pretty hard and very complicated.Why else would Japan be restarting its nuclear plants so soon after the Fukushimadisaster?"
p826
aS"It's because they need energy."
p827
aS"Why else would Pennsylvania be opening up itsshale gas resources for development?They'd like some jobs and economic benefits associated with it."
p828
aS'And, in fact, why arecoal states fighting so hard against the U.S. EPA Air Toxics Rules that would reduce theamount of coal burning in coal fired power plants?'
p829
aS'Surely the coal industry hassomething to do with that, but also there are a lot of jobs in that state tied to coal.So what has clean cheap gas provided for us in this pretty gray landscape so far?'
p830
aS'Joe toldyou about how natural gas is taking market share from coal in the power sector rightnow.'
p831
aS'In 2012 alone, Southern Company, which is one of the biggest owners of a coalfired power plant fleet in the country, expects to generate almost half of its power fromnatural gas.'
p832
aS"That's three times the amount from gas as it was five years ago."
p833
aS'And this isastonishing.'
p834
aS"Coal has dropped from 70 percent of its fleet to 30 percent of its fleet -- ofpower generation.Now, certainly in a compartmentalized way, Americans often get really agitated aboutenergy choices, but it's usually when it hits their backyard, as Kate and Deborah havetold you."
p835
aS"Unfortunately, every form of energy is in somebody's backyard."
p836
aS'Manycommunities are split about shale gas.'
p837
aS"Absolutely that's true."
p838
aS"Of course, somecommunities are split when they think that there's going to be a Wal-Mart comingbecause it affects the quality and tenor of their life in those areas."
p839
aS"But think about it,every type of energy facility that you can think of has split communities, whether it's awind farm in Cape Cod, the power lines across the Midwest to tie the America's SaudiArabia of wind to the people using wind in other parts of the country, nuclear plants,the case for shutting down existing coal plants, splits communities apart."
p840
aS"These splitstypically come down to jobs versus the environment, and that's surely the case here.Where I do agree with Kate and Deborah is that shale gas development does haveimportant environmental and community impact."
p841
aS'Should we regulate natural gasdevelopment more?'
p842
aS'Absolutely we should.'
p843
aS'Is regulation improving?'
p844
aS'Absolutely it is.Colorado and Pennsylvania are the prime cases for advancements that are leapfroggingfor best practices.'
p845
aS'The federal government is, too.'
p846
aS'Should we drop the so-calledHalliburton loophole, which exempts water injections associated with hydraulicfracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act?'
p847
aS'Why not?'
p848
aS'Wouldnt that provide a lot ofmore public trust than we have right now?'
p849
aS'Should we tighten up emissions of methanefrom the whole process?'
p850
aS'Absolutely we should.'
p851
aS'But do we think that the United Statesshould take shale gas off the table?'
p852
aS'No.'
p853
aS"That's unrealistic."
p854
aS"It's not even sensible.If we somehow -- someone in the United States could decide to do that, because it didmore harm then good, what would we get?We'd probably get a little bit more renewables, maybe a little faster."
p855
aS"We would get a lotmore coal use, and we'd have mountaintop mining, we'd have coal ash piles, some ofwhich have recently spilled into rivers, we'd have much higher CO2 emissions thatcontribute to global warming, and we'd have unhealthy levels of mercury emissions andother toxic chemicals."
p856
aS"There's a solution to all of these issues."
p857
aS'There are best practices.There should be much more aggressive attention to this.'
p858
aS'What I really wish is thatpeople would stop demonizing this fuel, because it makes it impossible to find sensiblesolutions in the middle.'
p859
aS'There are sensible solutions in the middle.'
p860
aS'We should beworking on enabling those to develop over time.'
p861
aS"Our main argument is that the twoprincipal sources of energy in the United States, coal and oil, are much more damagingto the environment than is natural gas, and that's for the communities where those areused as well as to the nation as a whole."

aS"If we rely on a regulated market, consumers and suppliers all around the country, every one of you is making energy choices every day, they don't have the authority to completely stop this, no single state could stop this, nor could the federal government."
p875
aS'On the consumer side, Americans tend not to think very much about energy.'
p876
aS"What they think about is getting to their job or getting to the shop where they hope to find lots of options, whether they can power their computers, or keep their homes warm or cool, and it's those realities that people don't think about energy that much."
p877
aS'That makes this a really hard issue to deal with.'
p878
aS'Everybody wants energy 24/7.'
p879
aS'They want it pretty cheap.'
p880
aS"Many say they'd like it to be clean, and many really suffer when prices go up."
p881
aS"That's the reality, and that makes this issue very gray and not as black and white as my opponents would tell you."
p882
aS'Deborah and Kate have set up in some sense a false dichotomy.'
p883
aS'They make it seem as though natural gas is evil and so everything else is pure.'
p884
aS"We know that that's not the case."
p885
aS'Surely we should be developing more wind and solar power.'
p886
aS"I'm sure everyone in this audience agrees with that."
p887
aS"Right now, seven percent of America's energy supply comes from renewable energy; most of that is from the Roosevelt-era hydroelectric facilities, those gigantic projects, none of which we would be able to build again for environmental impact reasons."
p888
aS'The other major portion of renewables right now comes from biofuels such as ethanol, with its own problems from an environmental impact point of view.'
p889
aS"Wind and solar are expected to grow, but even if they're 10 times as much as they are today, we're still talking about a long way to go and a small portion of the supply, and I hope we get there."
p890
aS"It's very hard."
p891
aS'But these and every other energy choice are really pretty hard and very complicated.'
p892
aS'Why else would Japan be restarting its nuclear plants so soon after the Fukushima disaster?'
p893
aS"It's because they need energy."
p894
aS'Why else would Pennsylvania be opening up its shale gas resources for development?'
p895
aS"They'd like some jobs and economic benefits associated with it."
p896
aS'And, in fact, why are coal states fighting so hard against the U.S. EPA Air Toxics Rules that would reduce the amount of coal burning in coal fired power plants?'
p897
aS'Surely the coal industry has something to do with that, but also there are a lot of jobs in that state tied to coal.'
p898
aS'So what has clean cheap gas provided for us in this pretty gray landscape so far?'
p899
aS'Joe told you about how natural gas is taking market share from coal in the power sector right now.'
p900
aS'In 2012 alone, Southern Company, which is one of the biggest owners of a coal fired power plant fleet in the country, expects to generate almost half of its power from natural gas.'
p901
aS"That's three times the amount from gas as it was five years ago."
p902
aS'And this is astonishing.'
p903
aS'Coal has dropped from 70 percent of its fleet to 30 percent of its fleet -- of power generation.'
p904
aS"Now, certainly in a compartmentalized way, Americans often get really agitated about energy choices, but it's usually when it hits their backyard, as Kate and Deborah have told you."
p905
aS"Unfortunately, every form of energy is in somebody's backyard."
p906
aS'Many communities are split about shale gas.'
p907
aS"Absolutely that's true."
p908
aS"Of course, some communities are split when they think that there's going to be a Wal-Mart coming because it affects the quality and tenor of their life in those areas."
p909
aS"But think about it, every type of energy facility that you can think of has split communities, whether it's a wind farm in Cape Cod, the power lines across the Midwest to tie the America's Saudi Arabia of wind to the people using wind in other parts of the country, nuclear plants, the case for shutting down existing coal plants, splits communities apart."
p910
aS"These splits typically come down to jobs versus the environment, and that's surely the case here."
p911
aS'Where I do agree with Kate and Deborah is that shale gas development does have important environmental and community impact.'
p912
aS'Should we regulate natural gas development more?'
p913
aS'Absolutely we should.'
p914
aS'Is regulation improving?'
p915
aS'Absolutely it is.'
p916
aS'Colorado and Pennsylvania are the prime cases for advancements that are leapfrogging for best practices.'
p917
aS'The federal government is, too.'
p918
aS'Should we drop the so-called Halliburton loophole, which exempts water injections associated with hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act?'
p919
aS'Why not?'
p920
aS'Wouldnt that provide a lot of more public trust than we have right now?'
p921
aS'Should we tighten up emissions of methane from the whole process?'
p922
aS'Absolutely we should.'
p923
aS'But do we think that the United States should take shale gas off the table?'
p924
aS'No.'
p925
aS"That's unrealistic."
p926
aS"It's not even sensible."
p927
aS'If we somehow -- someone in the United States could decide to do that, because it did more harm then good, what would we get?'
p928
aS"We'd probably get a little bit more renewables, maybe a little faster."
p929
aS"We would get a lot more coal use, and we'd have mountaintop mining, we'd have coal ash piles, some of which have recently spilled into rivers, we'd have much higher CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming, and we'd have unhealthy levels of mercury emissions and other toxic chemicals."
p930
aS"There's a solution to all of these issues."
p931
aS'There are best practices.'
p932
aS'There should be much more aggressive attention to this.'
p933
aS'What I really wish is that people would stop demonizing this fuel, because it makes it impossible to find sensible solutions in the middle.'
p934
aS'There are sensible solutions in the middle.'
p935
aS'We should be working on enabling those to develop over time.'
p936
aS"Our main argument is that the two principal sources of energy in the United States, coal and oil, are much more damaging to the environment than is natural gas, and that's for the communities where those are used as well as to the nation as a whole."

S'Thank you very much, Deborah Goldberg.'
p2930
aS'And that concludes Round 3 and this Intelligence Squared Debate.'
p2931
aS"And now it's time to find which side you feel has argued best."
p2932
aS"We're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat."
p2933
aS'Remember, we had you vote at the beginning of the debate on where you stood on this motion, No Fracking Way: The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good.'
p2934
aS'" You\'ve heard the arguments.'
p2935
aS'We want to ask you to judge which side presented their arguments best.'
p2936
aS'If you agree that this side presented the best arguments, the side that is for the motion, but that means that they are against, in a broad sense, fracking, push number one.'
p2937
aS'If its the other side, which takes the opposite position, push number two.'
p2938
aS'And if you are undecided or became undecided, push number three.'
p2939
aS"And we'll lock in the results in about 10 seconds, and in about 90 seconds we'll have the numbers for the two comparisons."
p2940
aS"So while that's being tabulated backstage, I just want to -- I really want to thank these debaters for doing what we asked them to do which was really bring good arguments to the -- -- and also just by point of comparison, it's our first time in Aspen, and, you know, as a rule, audience questions can be a sort of tricky area to go to."
p2941
aS'Tonight, this audience was spectacular in the questions, not just in the format, but really you moved things along, you put very, very interesting things into this debate, so I want to give yourselves a round of applause for that.'
p2942
aS'You did really good.'
p2943
aS"So just a few things to say, we want to again thank the Aspen Institute for inviting us down to this year's Ideas Festival, for letting you see what it is that we do back in New York at Intelligence Squared U.S."
p2944
aS'Thank you very much for the American Clean Skies Foundation, for their underwriting support for this, and making it all happen.'
p2945
aS"And if some of you are New Yorkers or going to New York, we want to let you know that this fall -- what we intend to do with our series of debate topics is to try to follow the ebb and flow of the dialogue that's taking place in the presidential election, and keep -- you know, bounce off what's actually happening in that debate by exploring the issues in more depth in our own debates."
p2946
aS"And so the motions that we're working on now will be announced in several weeks, and also who the debaters will be."
p2947
aS'So we have a website, IQ2US.org.'
p2948
aS'You can go look to that.'
p2949
aS'You can buy tickets there and keep in touch with us.'
p2950
aS'And if you get to New York, please do come.'
p2951
aS"Also, in mid-October, we're going to be on the road again."
p2952
aS"We're going to be going this time to Chicago."
p2953
aS"This'll be our second annual Chicago Ideas Week."
p2954
aS"If you're in New York, I should say, our -- we're changing locations."
p2955
aS"We're going to the Kauffman Center, which is near Lincoln Center."
p2956
aS'We can be seen on public television in New York and also here and around the country on the 220+ NPR stations.'
p2957
aS'We also have a podcast that is on iTunes.'
p2958
aS'And we have a newsletter.'
p2959
aS'You can sign up for our website.'
p2960
aS'So again, thank you very much for the debaters and for your participation.'
p2961
aS"And now we have the results, and we'll find out what happened."
p2962
aS'So remember, before the debate we asked you to vote on this motion, No Fracking Way: The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good.'
p2963
aS'If you\'re for the motion, it means you\'re saying, "No fracking way.'
p2964
aS'" If you\'re against the motion, you are disagreeing with "No fracking way.'
p2965
aS'" So before the debate, 38 percent of you were for the motion "No fracking way," 53 percent were against.'
p2966
aS"After the -- I'm sorry -- I'm sorry, it's a split."
p2967
aS"I'm going to start this again."
p2968
aS'Before the debate, 38 percent of you were for the motion, 38 percent, against, evenly split, and 24 percent were undecided.'
p2969
aS'After the debate, 53 percent of you are for the motion "No fracking way," that\'s up 15 percent, 42 percent are against, that\'s up only four percent, five percent are undecided, that means the team arguing for the motion "No fracking way," has won this debate.'
p2970
aS'Our congratulations to them.'
