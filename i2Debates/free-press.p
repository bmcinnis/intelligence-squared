p219
aS'At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago.'
p220
aS'To keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds.'
p221
aS'We cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists.'
p222
aS'We cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings.'
p223
aS'We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax.'
p224
aS'But equally at stake is the character of our democracy.'
p225
aS'We live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea.'
p226
aS'Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing.'
p227
aS"And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it's doing in secret, or at least some of them."
p228
aS'And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets.'
p229
aS"And that's the way things are, and that's the way they ought to be."
p230
aS'But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law.'
p231
aS'That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy.'
p232
aS'Now here, as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the First Amendment.'
p233
aS'The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the press.'
p234
aS'But, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts.'
p235
aS"We can't libel one another."
p236
aS"We can't engage in false advertising."
p237
aS'And of course, it\'s forbidden to yell, "Fire" -- falsely yell, "Fire" in a crowded theater like this one.'
p238
aS'Now, Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets.'
p239
aS'The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons.'
p240
aS'Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government.'
p241
aS'Now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment, but no court has ever struck them down.'
p242
aS'And it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true.'
p243
aS'Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets.'
p244
aS'Now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, David Sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison?'
p245
aS'Absolutely not.'
p246
aS'That would be foolish in the extreme.'
p247
aS"That's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp."
p248
aS'It marks lots of things secret that need not be.'
p249
aS'And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do so again.'
p250
aS'The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger.'
p251
aS'Such danger is not purely hypothetical.'
p252
aS'Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world.'
p253
aS'In 1975, it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens.'
p254
aS'And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation.'
p255
aS'Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet.'
p256
aS'Now, some of those documents are innocuous.'
p257
aS'And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous.'
p258
aS'One WikiLeaks document, a U.S. Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs.'
p259
aS'Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield?'
p260
aS'Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax?'
p261
aS'Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz.'
p262
aS"If they believe those things should be allowed, I hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose."
p263
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets.'
p264
aS'Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do.'
p265
aS'And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight.'

p303
aS'And back when I was an editor atCommentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do soagain.'
p304
aS'The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should beprosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger.'
p305
aS'Such danger is notpurely hypothetical.'
p306
aS'Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy thatbegan to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world.'
p307
aS'In 1975, itouted Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens.'
p308
aS'And no sooner was his namedisclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of thatrevelation.Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminatelydumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet.'
p309
aS'Now, someof those documents are innocuous.'
p310
aS'And many of them without question help us betterunderstand what our government is doing around the world and what other governmentsare doing, but some of them are outright dangerous.'
p311
aS'One WikiLeaks document, a U.S.Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of thejamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents wereusing to detonate roadside bombs.'
p312
aS'Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person whobelieves it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers tokeep from getting blown up on the battlefield?Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints formaking nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish therecipe for making aerosolized anthrax?'
p313
aS'Those are questions that I hope we will receivestraightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz.'
p314
aS"If theybelieve those things should be allowed, I hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge thecosts, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll beagreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose."
p315
aS'Ladies andgentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets.Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do.'
p316
aS'And if you in theaudience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that theConstitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for theproposition at issue here tonight.Thank you.'

p359
aS"And I admire much of what he writes, but we disagree, and you'll hear the disagreements."
p360
aS'And Judge Michael Chertoff, whose work as a public figure deserves all of our appreciation.'
p361
aS'He has helped protect us for so many years.'
p362
aS'And of course, my distinguished colleague who will be arguing on my side.'
p363
aS'The proposition is far too broad.'
p364
aS'State secrets encompass far too much.'
p365
aS'And even the criteria used by my opponent -- quote places the country in danger -- is far, far too broad.'
p366
aS'Let me start with a story that one of my dissident clients told me in the 1970s, when I was representing Soviet dissidents in the bad old days of the Soviet Union.'
p367
aS"The joke went around during Stalin's time that a dissident was arrested for the crime of calling Stalin a fool."
p368
aS"And he came to court and he said, I didn't commit a libel."
p369
aS'I want to defend myself.'
p370
aS'I will prove that what I said is truthful.'
p371
aS"And he said, You don't understand."
p372
aS"You're not being charged with libel."
p373
aS"You're being charged with revealing a state secret!"
p374
aS"And that's precisely the kind of state secret that we often seek to protect."
p375
aS"Now, you don't have to be Stalin."
p376
aS'Remember, everybody knows -- every newspaperman memorizes the famous quote of Thomas Jefferson that he made before he became a president.'
p377
aS'He said, Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.'
p378
aS'That was pre-presidential Thomas Jefferson.'
p379
aS'Now let me read you a quote six years into his presidency: A man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them.'
p380
aS'And as much as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.'
p381
aS'Thomas Jefferson sought to censor the press.'
p382
aS'We all know that he opposed the Alien and Sedition Act.'
p383
aS'Of course he did, because that was federal legislation.'
p384
aS'But he supported state legislation that would have censored the press and protected him from embarrassment.'
p385
aS"Now, you just have to look in today's New York Times to see how foolish some of these state secrets that are protected tend to be."
p386
aS'Finally, finally, the Pentagon papers are about to be declassified and released.'
p387
aS'I defended Senator Mike Gravel against the charges of reading the Pentagon papers -- what was it -- 40 years ago!'
p388
aS"And Daniel Ellsberg, in today's Times, I think aptly states the reason why the Pentagon papers were censored for so long."
p389
aS'He said, The reasons are very clearly domestic political reasons, not national security at all.'
p390
aS"The reasons for the prolonged secrets are to conceal the fact that so much of the policy making doesn't bear public examination."
p391
aS"It's embarrassing or even incriminating."
p392
aS"You don't have to be as cynical as Ellsberg -- and Ellsberg is not one of my heroes."
p393
aS"I agree with Gabriel Schoenberg's analysis of Ellsberg for the man."
p394
aS'But the point is a very, very important one.'
p395
aS'Secrets get disclosed all the time.'
p396
aS'And the issue is not whether secrets will be disclosed.'
p397
aS'If you read The New York Times, if you read Bob Woodward, if you read Seymour Hersh, you understand the question is who decides which secrets are disclosed to whom?'
p398
aS'When?'
p399
aS'Secrets get disclosed.'
p400
aS'Bob Woodward has its sources.'
p401
aS'Why do people talk to Bob Woodward?'
p402
aS'Why do they give him classified information?'
p403
aS'Why do they give Seymour Hersh classified information?'
p404
aS'Because those are secrets that government officials want to have revealed.'
p405
aS'So the question is not Should state secrets be subject to the First Amendment?'
p406
aS'The question is, Should the government -- the executive branch of the government -- be making the decision as to which secrets to withhold and which to reveal?'
p407
aS'Secrets should be kept.'
p408
aS'And the primary responsibility for keeping secrets lies with those who have those secrets.'
p409
aS'If you look, for example, at how WikiLeaks got disclosed, the alleged culprit there is man -- a private named Bradley Manning -- who have never should have had access -- such easy access to the material that he disclosed.'
p410
aS'That was negligence on the part of the government.'
p411
aS'As Julian Assange, I think, aptly put it, The best way to keep a secret is not to know it.'
p412
aS'And if the government wants to keep secrets, they have to do a better job of preventing them from being leaked -- and not put the burden on the press.'
p413
aS"And by the way, I mean not only leaked WikiLeaks style, but leaked Bob Woodward, Seymour Hersh style, the kind of selective leaks that we've come to grow accustomed to."
p414
aS'There are very limited numbers of secrets that deserve to be protected.'
p415
aS'And they can be listed and catalogued.'
p416
aS'You listed some of them.'
p417
aS'I agree with some.'
p418
aS'I disagree with others.'
p419
aS'The names of troops, of the nature of weapons.'
p420
aS'But you mentioned a couple, for example, methods used to track terrorists, vulnerability of bridges.'
p421
aS'Those are very complicated.'
p422
aS"We have a right to know, at least in broad terms, what kinds of methods are being used, whether they're constitutional or not."
p423
aS"We have a right to know if our bridges are vulnerable, not how they're vulnerable."
p424
aS'These are very, very hard judgments.'
p425
aS'So you can agree with our side of the proposition while conceding that there are a limited number of things that should be kept secret.'
p426
aS'And I believe -- and here we have a real disagreement.'
p427
aS'You wrote in your book that you would prefer to leave this to the good judgment of prosecutors, the discretion of prosecutors and the common sense of jurors.'
p428
aS'What I would prefer to see is a complete starting from scratch with the Espionage Law of 1917.'
p429
aS'Scrap it.'
p430
aS'It tells us nothing.'
p431
aS'And draft a very narrow statute that says you cannot disclose the nature of certain kinds of weapons.'
p432
aS'You cannot disclose the movement of troops.'
p433
aS'You cannot disclose the names of spies.'
p434
aS'That is not state secrets, broad general concept.'
p435
aS"That's a limited number of things that need protection, not protection from The New York Times because the Times won't publish them, but protection from Internet people who will publish almost anything without any kind of accountability."
p436
aS'There must be a strong presumption in favor of freedom of speech and sunshine as the best disinfectant.'
p437
aS'The government says, "Trust us.'
p438
aS'" No.'
p439
aS"Don't trust the government."
p440
aS'The New York Times says, "Trust us.'
p441
aS'" Don\'t trust The New York Times.'
p442
aS'Trust the process of checks and balances, whereby the government tries to keep secrets.'
p443
aS'The press tries to release the secrets.'

S'Thank you, very much.'
p575
aS'First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate.'
p576
aS"I think it's a critical issue for the country."
p577
aS"I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors."
p578
aS"I think, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets."
p579
aS'Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis.'
p580
aS'But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision.'
p581
aS'Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press.'
p582
aS'Does the press get the final say?'
p583
aS'Now, I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets.'
p584
aS'And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so.'
p585
aS'Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets.'
p586
aS'And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed.'
p587
aS'But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets.'
p588
aS'And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives.'
p589
aS'Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement.'
p590
aS'And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States.'
p591
aS'And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely.'
p592
aS'National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game.'
p593
aS'And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance.'
p594
aS'How does that work?'
p595
aS"Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so."
p596
aS"And there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material."
p597
aS'But we do have cases where the material gets out.'
p598
aS'And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret.'
p599

p603
aS'And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material.'

p621
aS'Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration, that material was published.'
p622
aS"And the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight."

S'Thank you, very much.First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate.'
p643
aS"I think it's a critical issue for [[applause]] the country.I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors."
p644
aS"Ithink, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded theproposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the presshas to give way to state secrets."
p645
aS'Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition meanseverything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguingthat simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret endsthe analysis.'
p646
aS'But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes thedecision.'
p647
aS'Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contentionis and our proposition is, or is it the press.'
p648
aS'Does the press get the final say?'
p649
aS'Now, I willagree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with thisproblem is for the government to control its own secrets.And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so.'
p650
aS'Although the press isconstantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access tothose secrets.'
p651
aS'And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed.'
p652
aS'But the reality isthat there are times people do leak secrets.'
p653
aS'And sometimes they do it for what they mayconceive to be noble motives.'
p654
aS'Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores orpersonal advancement.'
p655
aS'And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt theUnited States.'
p656
aS'And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because thegovernment has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought tobe published widely.'
p657
aS'National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat andmouse game.'
p658
aS'And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does requirefreedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correctbalance.'
p659
aS"How does that work?Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it'svery difficult to do so."
p660
aS"And there's a very strong presumption against simply open accessto very significant classified material."
p661
aS"But we do have cases where the material gets out.And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, aprosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret.And that's in fact what the law basically is."
p662
aS'There are statutes in the books that permitthose prosecutions.'
p663
aS'When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, andthose are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions.Even in the Pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven,indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if notin that particular case.And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to preventpublication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a verystrong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication ofinformation about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin thepublication of that material.'

aS"The problem is, as a reporter, I probably don't even know when much of that material is classified."
p736

p743
