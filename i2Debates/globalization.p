p179

p180
aS'It is more than we can afford, more than a trillion dollars on two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq.'
p181
aS"But beyond the fact that we can't afford it -- and my colleague, Larry Korb, will make that case, it is that we are not capable of doing it."
p182
aS'We do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs, the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war.'
p183
aS'The fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises, and we did not succeed.'

aS'In fact, I will argue to you that we have not only not helped the United States, we have undermined Americas national security.'
p185
aS'Now I want to be clear.'
p186
aS'Larry Korb and I are not isolationists, we are not against U.S. -- use of U.S. power in the world.'
p187
aS'When I served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia, I argued strongly for U.S. airstrikes against the Serbs who were attacking Sarajevo and civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and when those airstrikes took place, they combined with intense diplomacy, they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end.'
p188
aS'It was effective.'
p189
aS'Larry Korb and I support the intervention in Libya, and it is -- for the same reason that it is working in Bosnia -- it was in Bosnia and in Libya we had limited ambitions.'
p190
aS'In Bosnia it was to end the war, in Libya to protect civilians.'
p191
aS'We had allies in Bosnia, the Europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction.'
p192
aS'Theyre doing much of the heavy lifting in Libya, and we had partners on the ground.'
p193
aS'That is not the case in Iraq or in Afghanistan.'
p194
aS'In the case of Iraq, we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government, and in the end, who ended up as the victor?'
p195
aS'Iran.'
p196
aS'For eight years, the Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerical government in Iran fought the Iran-Iraq War, at a cost of a half a million Iranian soldiers for the goal of installing, of getting rid of Saddam Hussein, and of installing in power Dawa and SCIRI, two Iranian-supported Shiite parties.'
p197
aS'They failed.'
p198
aS'In 2003, the U.S. went in, and who is it that is in power in Iraq but the Dawa has the prime ministership, SCIRI plays a major role.'
p199
aS'Talk about unintended consequences.'
p200
aS'In Afghanistan, the United States is embarked on a counterinsurgency, I want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the Taliban, to drive out -- to try to kill and capture Al-Qaeda was correct, morally justified, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires -- if General Petraeus were here, its architect, he would say just what Im going to say -- it requires a local partner for it to work.'
p201
aS'Our partner in Afghanistan is Hamid Karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world -- number one is Somalia which doesnt have a government at all -- is ineffective, illegitimate, having stolen his last election through massive fraud, and as a result, the strategy doesnt work.'
p202
aS'We have invested billions in training an Afghan police force.'
p203
aS"Our idea is that by training an Afghan police force, they'll be partners who can provide security, and why do we train the police?"
p204
aS'Because thats what we know how to do, but the problem in Afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt Afghan regime.'
p205
aS'The money that weve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in Afghanistan isnt working because, yes, the roads are there, farmers dont bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market.'
p206
aS'We can train the police to be policemen, but we cannot make them honest.'
p207
aS'Afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions.'
p208
aS'We are spending this year $117 billion on the Afghanistan war.'
p209
aS'To fight an enemy, the Taliban, whose budget is estimated between $70 million and $200 million, and how do the Taliban fund themselves?'
p210
aS'From the United States.'
p211
aS'Why?'
p212
aS'Because to supply our military in Afghanistan, we bring in supplies to the Pakistani port of Karachi, they go through Taliban-controlled territory.'
p213
aS'The contractors pay off the Taliban.'
p214
aS'And with the money used to pay for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we ourselves are financing the Taliban.'
p215
aS'Now look at this from the point of view from the extremists.'
p216
aS'We can spend $70 million and get the U.S. to spend $117 billion.'
p217
aS'That is a pretty good investment.'
p218
aS'So, our position is simple.'
p219
aS'We need to scale back what the United States is doing in the world.'
p220
aS'Yes, to continue global engagements.'
p221

aS'The topic of the debate was not, The Iraq War: Good Idea, Bad Idea?'
p311
aS'The topic was not, Afghanistan: Well Conducted, Poorly Conducted?'
p312
aS'The topic is should we clip Americas global wings?'

aS'Its not a debate about President Obama.'
p315
aS'Its not a debate about Iraq.'
p316
aS'It is not a debate about Libya.'
p317
aS'It is not debate about Afghanistan.'
p318
aS'It is most certainly not a debate about whether prudence is better than recklessness.'
p319
aS'Its not a debate about military power versus soft power.'
p320
aS'It is a debate about Americas role in the world.'
p321
aS'Our view -- my view and the view of the Elliot who cant spell his own first name correctly -- -- is very much that of a statesman who said that the United States is an anchor of global security and an advocate for human freedom.'
p322
aS'That would be President Barack Obama.'
p323
aS'It is the mainstream view.'
p324
aS'Now, our colleagues have chosen or have agreed to a metaphor which is not one that I would have signed up to.'
p325
aS'When you clip a birds wings, it can only fly so high or so far.'
p326
aS'Its not a question of where you try to get the bird to fly; its what the bird can do.'
p327
aS'So the question that they will have to address is what capabilities should we give up, not what waste should we curtail?'

p329
aS'What regions of the world no longer matter to us?'
p330

aS'And what will be the consequences when we do so?'
p332
aS'Theyve already begun by making a number of distinctions, some of which I have to say I find difficult to understand.'
p333
aS'We have limited objectives in Libya when President Obama has said that Gaddafi has got to go.'
p334
aS'We have local allies.'
p335
aS'Exactly who?'
p336

p337
aS'Our opponents will and have begun making a number of arguments.'
p338
aS'They will argue -- they have argued that this is way too costly.'
p339
aS'I would just remind the audience of one statistical fact.'
p340
aS'The United States today spends something on the order of about five percent of Gross Domestic Product on defense, maybe a little bit more.'
p341
aS'During the Kennedy administration, that figure was over eight percent, during the Eisenhower administration, over 10 percent.'
p342
aS'Even with the vast expenses of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is not the defense budget that is the cause of our current economic difficulties.'
p343
aS'Our record is tarnished.'
p344
aS'Well, the price of action is frequently exposing yourself in that way.'
p345
aS'There were plenty of air strikes in Bosnia, the war that Ambassador Galbraith favored, that killed civilians.'
p346
aS'Thats the price of going to war.'
p347
aS'I want to make a larger point about the world view that Elliot and I share and that, really, I think, informs our position in this.'
p348
aS'The first is a set of propositions about the United States, of which the most important is this: The United States has always been a global nation from the very beginning.'
p349
aS'We were born as part of an Atlantic community.'
p350
aS'From the outset, our trade stretched across the world, to China and to the Middle East.'
p351
aS'When the United States chose not to act as a global power with global responsibilities, we were not always the ones who paid for that.'
p352
aS'When we did -- and of course, the time that we all think of is the period after World War II -- it was not simply that the United States used its force wisely, as I believe it did.'
p353
aS'It built enduring edifices of alliances, institutions and practices that have served us and have served the world well.'
p354
aS'Fundamentally, I think the difference comes down to this: Elliott and I believe that the United States is a force for good in the world.'
p355
aS"That doesn't mean that we don't make mistakes."
p356
aS'Of course, we will.'
p357
aS'That is, in many ways, the price of action.'
p358
aS'But we believe that the United States has been a force for good, can be a force for good and should continue to think of itself that way.'
p359
aS'We share a second fundamental world view, and that is a view about the nature of our environment.'
p360
aS"In many ways, we've entered a world which is a dangerous and difficult place, not just thinking of issues like nuclear proliferation or global warming."
p361
aS"By the way, it's not clear to me that if you clip America's global wings, why doesn't that cover things like the United States taking the lead on global warming?"
p362
aS'But beyond that, we live at a time of tremendous movements in human history.'
p363
aS"I'll just mention two."
p364
aS'In the last decade, hundreds of millions of Chinese have risen out of poverty.'
p365
aS'That is unambiguously a good thing.'
p366
aS"It is a good thing that countries like China don't have to worry about famine, that Chinese fathers and mothers can have expectations of a better life for their children than they have had."
p367
aS'But it is also true that the same economic growth that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty, arms a military establishment which acts in support of a foreign policy that claims, among other things, territorial rights to the South and East China seas, to include the territory of some of our closest allies like Japan.'
p368
aS"Well, let's take the dramatic events of recent months, the Arab spring."
p369
aS'In many ways, this is say good thing.'
p370
aS"There's no question about that."
p371
aS'It is quite an extraordinary thing to watch.'
p372
aS"By the way, it's very striking, I think, to me and to many others, that there's not very much -- there's no anti-Americanism in any of that."
p373
aS"But there's clearly potential for this to go in a number of directions."
p374
aS"Our fundamental position is it's in America's interest to act where we can act, to guide and shape these events and not to be timid and not to be afraid, to exercise leadership that only the United States can lead."

p504
aS'We borrow -- put it another way -- $4 billion a day.'
p505
aS"Now, if you go back and you take a look -- and I know our opponents don't want to talk about the previous administration."
p506
aS'Go back to the beginning of this century.'
p507
aS"The beginning of this century, the United States accounted for one-third of the world's Gross Domestic Product."
p508
aS'We spent one- third of what the world spends on military.'
p509
aS"Here we are today, we account for only one quarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product, but yet we account for half of the world's military expenditures."
p510
aS"Five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense."
p511
aS'Now, remember at the beginning of this century, we had a budget surplus.'
p512
aS'You may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000.'
p513
aS'That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Security would not run out of money quicker than it has.'
p514
aS'Where did we end up at the end of this decade?'
p515
aS'Not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion.'
p516
aS'And then, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit even more.'
p517
aS'Now, the question becomes, how do we get there?'
p518
aS'Defense played a part.'
p519
aS'The war has played a part.'
p520
aS"It wasn't the only part, but I think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968, when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam, we balanced the budget."
p521
aS'How did we do it?'
p522
aS'We had a surtax, a war surtax.'
p523
aS'What happened this time?'
p524
aS'You can be for or against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.'
p525
aS"But the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn't pay for it."
p526
aS'In fact, what we did is we cut taxes.'
p527
aS"We've never done that in our -- in our history."
p528
aS'And what happened?'
p529
aS'The wars cost -- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far.'
p530
aS"But the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a long time."
p531
aS"And Joe Stiglitz up here, a Columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5 trillion."
p532
aS'We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call the baseline budget.'
p533
aS'General McChrystal, who everybody knows, I had the privilege of working with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago.'
p534
aS'Before he went to Afghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget.'
p535
aS"And he told me, when I spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make any choices."
p536
aS'We could have everything.'
p537
aS'The baseline budget also went up during this particular period.'
p538
aS"Again, during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs, we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our national security."
p539
aS"Now, you don't think the deficit's a problem?"
p540
aS"Admiral Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it's the biggest threat to national security."
p541
aS"And he says unless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad."
p542
aS'Now, the defense and I agree with it.'
p543
aS"Wasn't the only thing."
p544
aS'We as individuals live beyond our means.'
p545
aS'We all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year.'
p546
aS'And, you know, we made our decisions on that basis.'
p547
aS'States right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year.'
p548
aS"Well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems."
p549
aS'Now, the question becomes, okay, now we have these problems.'
p550
aS'Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world.'
p551
aS"And again, we're not against involvement."
p552
aS'But it has to be selective engagement.'
p553
aS"You can't deal with every situation."
p554
aS"But we've got a lot of challenges at home."
p555
aS'You probably have seen all of the statistics.'
p556
aS"We're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math."
p557
aS'These are our children.'
p558
aS'Our infrastructure is falling apart.'
p559
aS"We're 27th in life expectancy."
p560
aS'You know, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things.'
p561
aS"Obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty -- poverty line."
p562
aS"And what we're doing, as a country, we're living off our past investments."
p563
aS"If you go back and look where we are today, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s."
p564
aS'Now, can you cut defense?'
p565
aS'Yeah, you sure can.'
p566
aS"If you take a look at what we're spending on defense, and you put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the Cold War average, it was 450 billion."
p567
aS"Right now it's 550 billion."
p568
aS"How do I know it's too much?"
p569
aS'Secretary of Defense says $150 billion in inefficiencies.'
p570
aS'Well, we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home.'
p571
aS'And a couple of things, you know, that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are -- Secretary Gates, Secretary of Defense goes to West Point.'
p572
aS'Were not going to send large land armies into Muslim countries again, okay?'
p573
aS'This is a man who worked for President Reagan, worked for President Bush, is now working for President Obama.'
p574
aS'Well, if youre not going to do that, lets take a look at the size of the Army and the Marine Corps.'
p575
aS'This is something that you can do.'
p576
aS'We also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve them all.'
p577
aS'And I think, as Peter pointed out, I think Libyas the perfect example of the way to do that.'
p578
aS'We used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you know whos a great example for this, the first President Bush.'
p579
aS'You may remember in the campaign, President Obama said, I like President Bush, and everybody said, You do?'
p580
aS'and he said, Well, the first President Bush.'
p581
aS'The first Persian Gulf War we got over 200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldnt send troops, we collected money.'
p582
aS'We collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war.'
p583
aS'So it didnt cost us anything and, in conclusion, weve done it before.'
p584
aS'Eisenhower got us out of Korea, wouldnt go into Hungary and Poland, or into Vietnam.'
p585
aS'Nixon got us out of Vietnam, started arms control with the Soviet Union, recognized China, and even Reagan, when he started negotiating with the Russians, you know what Newt Gingrich called him?'

aS'We borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federalgovernment spends.'
p599
aS'We borrow -- put it another way -- $4 billion a day.'
p600
aS"Now, if you goback and you take a look -- and I know our opponents don't want to talk about theprevious administration.Go back to the beginning of this century."
p601
aS"The beginning of this century, the UnitedStates accounted for one-third of the world's Gross Domestic Product."
p602
aS'We spent one-third of what the world spends on military.'
p603
aS"Here we are today, we account for only onequarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product, but yet we account for half of the world'smilitary expenditures."
p604
aS"Five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half ofwhat the rest of the world spends on defense."
p605
aS'Now, remember at the beginning of thiscentury, we had a budget surplus.'
p606
aS'You may remember the lockbox and all of thosedebates back in 2000.'
p607
aS'That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Securitywould not run out of money quicker than it has.'
p608
aS'Where did we end up at the end of thisdecade?'
p609
aS'Not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion.'
p610
aS'Andthen, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit evenmore.Now, the question becomes, how do we get there?'
p611
aS'Defense played a part.'
p612
aS'The war hasplayed a part.'
p613
aS"It wasn't the only part, but I think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968,when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam, we balanced the budget."
p614
aS'How did we do it?We had a surtax, a war surtax.'
p615
aS'What happened this time?'
p616
aS'You can be for or against thewars in Iraq and Afghanistan.'
p617
aS"But the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn'tpay for it."
p618
aS'In fact, what we did is we cut taxes.'
p619
aS"We've never done that in our -- in ourhistory."
p620
aS'And what happened?'
p621
aS'The wars cost -- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollarsso far.'
p622
aS"But the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a longtime."
p623
aS"And Joe Stiglitz up here, a Columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5trillion.We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call thebaseline budget."
p624
aS'General McChrystal, who everybody knows, I had the privilege ofworking with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago.'
p625
aS'Before he went toAfghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget.'
p626
aS"Andhe told me, when I spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make anychoices."
p627
aS'We could have everything.'
p628
aS'The baseline budget also went up during thisparticular period.'
p629
aS"Again, during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs, welooked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our nationalsecurity."
p630
aS"Now, you don't think the deficit's a problem?"
p631
aS"Admiral Mullen, the chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff said it's the biggest threat to national security."
p632
aS"And he saysunless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad."
p633
aS'Now, thedefense and I agree with it.'
p634
aS"Wasn't the only thing.We as individuals live beyond our means."
p635
aS'We all assume that housing prices were goingto go up 30 percent a year.'
p636
aS'And, you know, we made our decisions on that basis.'
p637
aS"Statesright now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for thepolicemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year.Well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems."
p638
aS'Now, the question becomes, okay,now we have these problems.'
p639
aS'Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world.'
p640
aS"Andagain, we're not against involvement."
p641
aS'But it has to be selective engagement.'
p642
aS"You can'tdeal with every situation."
p643
aS"But we've got a lot of challenges at home."
p644
aS'You probably haveseen all of the statistics.'
p645
aS"We're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math."
p646
aS'These areour children.'
p647
aS'Our infrastructure is falling apart.'
p648
aS"We're 27th in life expectancy."
p649
aS"Youknow, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things.Obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and thenumber of people who are below the poverty -- poverty line."
p650
aS"And what we're doing, as acountry, we're living off our past investments."
p651
aS"If you go back and look where we aretoday, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s."
p652
aS'Now, can you cutdefense?'
p653
aS'Yeah, you sure can.'
p654
aS"If you take a look at what we're spending on defense, andyou put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the Cold War average, it was 450billion."
p655
aS"Right now it's 550 billion."
p656
aS"How do I know it's too much?"
p657
aS'Secretary of Defensesays $150 billion in inefficiencies.'
p658
aS'Well, we could take that money and use it to dealwith some of the problems at home.'
p659
aS'And a couple of things, you know, that we couldtake a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are -- Secretary Gates, Secretary ofDefense goes to West Point.'
p660
aS'Were not going to send large land armies into Muslimcountries again, okay?This is a man who worked for President Reagan, worked for President Bush, is nowworking for President Obama.'
p661
aS'Well, if youre not going to do that, lets take a look at thesize of the Army and the Marine Corps.'
p662
aS'This is something that you can do.'
p663
aS'We alsohave to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve themall.'
p664
aS'And I think, as Peter pointed out, I think Libyas the perfect example of the way todo that.'
p665
aS'We used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you knowwhos a great example for this, the first President Bush.'
p666
aS'You may remember in thecampaign, President Obama said, I like President Bush, and everybody said, You do?and he said, Well, the first President Bush.'
p667
aS'The first Persian Gulf War we got over200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldnt send troops, we collectedmoney.'
p668
aS'We collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war.'
p669
aS'So it didnt cost usanything and, in conclusion, weve done it before.Eisenhower got us out of Korea, wouldnt go into Hungary and Poland, or into Vietnam.Nixon got us out of Vietnam, started arms control with the Soviet Union, recognizedChina, and even Reagan, when he started negotiating with the Russians, you know whatNewt Gingrich called him?'
