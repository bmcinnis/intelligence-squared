aS'WhatI have is my story.I am a Muslim American woman born and raised in Toledo, Ohio by two very lovingIndian Muslim parents.'
p153
aS'My sister, brother, and I were raised in a middle-class Americanhome.'
p154
aS'We went to Mosque on Sundays, attended Sunday school classes, and prayed thecommunity prayer with our community of Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Syrian Muslims.When I was in high school, our Mosque president was a woman, who did not wear aheadscarf.'
p155
aS'And it may come as a surprise to some of you, but for the entirety of my lifemen and women have prayed side by side at our Mosque, and both can enter the prayerhall using the same door.My parents are both very religious people, but they express their faith in different ways.My father emphasizes the devotional, and he tends to spend his time praying and recitingthe Koran, whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach.She uses community service and volunteering to express hers.'
p156
aS'But what they both share isfundamental Islamic principles.'
p157
aS'First and foremost, seek knowledge.'
p158
aS'They urged theirchildren, all three of us, to question, to have critical minds, and to doubt.'
p159
aS'They wanted usto engage fully with our faith and to question everything.'
p160
aS'They lived out the Koraniccommandments that there is no compulsion in religion, and also that God said, in theKoran, I made you into many tribes so that you might know one another.'
p161
aS'And as such,they enrolled me and my siblings in a Hebrew day school for nine years, where welearned Hebrew, read the Torah, and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning.'
p162
aS'Theyalways wanted us to learn about other faiths, and they always made sure that we knew thedifference, though, between Islam and Judaism.'
p163
aS'But they also made sure we alsorespected our Jewish sisters and brothers in faith.My story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries.'
p164
aS'The Muslim population isone of the most diverse and eclectic in the world.'
p165
aS'We are Sunnis, we are Shias, and evenin the Shia tradition there are Zaidis, Ismailis, Ismasheries .'
p166
aS'Thereare numerous madhhabs, or schools of thought, and Sufi mystic orders.'
p167
aS'Like Christiansand Jews, Muslims can be observant, nonobservant, performist, humanist, secularist,extremist, mainstream, and there are even some Muslims who consider themselvesculturally Muslims but are actually atheists.Now, the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether Islam is areligion of peace.'
p168
aS'And at first blush, that might seem a bit tricky to decide.'
p169
aS'After all, theKoran and the Hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love.'
p170
aS'Butthere are other verses that are violent, are about violence and about violence againstspecific people.'
p171
aS'So how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses?How then do we decide whether Islam is a religion of peace?'
p172
aS'The only way to answerthat question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how theyinterpret it.'
p173
aS"According to Gallup's ground breaking study on what a billion Muslimsthink, 93 percent of Muslims around the world are peaceful, mainstream Muslims."
p174
aS'Sevenpercent are what Gallup determines as politically radicalized.'
p175
aS"And within that sevenpercent, there's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence."
p176
aS'Any percentis too much.'
p177
aS'But we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivatedby politics, not religion.'
p178
aS'As Gallup concluded, what distinguishes the politicallyradicalized Muslims from the mainstream Muslims is their politics, not their piety.Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, further confirmed this in hisbook, Dying to Win, in which he came to the same conclusion, that the actions ofterrorists are politically motivated, not through religion.'
p179
aS"The Tamil Tigers, for example,which are predominantly a Hindu group, used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing,did so far secessionist reasons, not for religious goals.Our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all, no winner clash betweenIslam and the West, and that Muslims who try to balance their Western values and Islamarrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internalstruggle.That distribution description doesn't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends orfor my community, because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict witheach other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other."
p180
aS"I didn't realizethat there were people out there who wondered whether people -- Muslims like meexisted or could exist until after 9/11.Let me be clear."
p181
aS'There are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist ourfaith to justify their hate and their violence.'

aS'Shespeaks for Islam.'
p187
aS'And the entire Muslim community of India, who, when the authoritiesasked them to take the militants who attacked Mumbai in 2008, said resoundingly andcollectively no.'
p188
aS'We will not let the terrorists be buried with us.The media and those who profit from the narrative of Islam versus the West are nevergoing to tell you my story or the stories of these Muslims who constitute the vast majorityof Muslims around the world.'

aS'The mostcommon definition of religion you will find is the universal quest of humans in search --in search of the sacred or the holy.'
p319
aS'That search is expressed intellectually.'
p320
aS"It's expressedin practice."
p321
aS'It is expressed in fellowship.'

aS'Monotheistic religions know periods, lengthy periodsof peace, but they also know lengthy periods of war.In times of practice, yes, in Islam, you practice charity, you go to Hajj, you pray, all ofthat.'
p327
aS"But in terms of practice, there is also the expression, there is the concept of jihad.And I find it a pity that Zeba Khan did not mention that concept, which is central toIslam's conquests and Islam's success."
p328
aS'The founder of Islam, Mohammad, in his lifetime,conducted 65 campaigns of war that were all successful.'

aS'And that militaristic history ofIslam is well documented.'
p330
aS'Just go Google it.'
p331
aS"And if you don't find it on Google, go to allthose former empires that were conquered.The combination of a history of empire, of conquest, also leaves a legacy behind."

aS"That's where SamuelHuntington had a point."
p335
aS"That history of militarism, combined with the legacy of empire,those two points alone belie the motion tonight, that Islam is a religion of peace, but that'snot all."
p336
aS'When empires decline, those who are defeated, and the Muslim Empire declined,those who are defeated sometimes themselves in a state of victimhood.'
p337
aS'That state ofvictimhood is exploited by the leadership or the self-appointed leaders of Islam.'

p340
aS'Yes, it was external, yes, Muslims were humiliated, yes,they were conquered, yes, they were colonized, but how much was also because of theflaws of Islam?And that takes me to the point of absolutism.'

p499
aS'So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity.'
p500
aS'I want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about.'
p501
aS'This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism.'
p502
aS'Basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the West and also in Muslim majority countries.'
p503
aS"I've just flown right in from Pakistan where I've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in Pakistan."
p504
aS"And I'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on Facebook."
p505
aS'So this debate -- -- this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside Israel.'
p506
aS'We make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism, for extremism, and for people who kill innocent civilians, including inside Israel.'
p507
aS'This debate acknowledges, we, on our panel, Zeba and myself, acknowledge that Muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it, and more Muslims need to do that more actively.'
p508
aS'We acknowledge that Muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those -- the minority who have hijacked Islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of Islam.'
p509
aS'We acknowledge that, and I am in my own person a manifestation of that effort, as is Zeba in the way she was raised.'
p510
aS'So we acknowledge that as well.'
p511
aS'This debate, in fact, is an appeal.'
p512
aS'Its not -- also, before I move to the fact that its an appeal, its also not a threat.'
p513
aS'So, were not going to argue here tonight that if you dont vote for the motion, that somehow Muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting Islam.'
p514
aS'Thats not the case.'
p515
aS'This is an appeal.'
p516
aS'And its an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you.'
p517
aS'This is not a debate for Islam at all.'
p518
aS'This is a debate for peace.'
p519
aS'And we are not arguing for Islamic peace; were arguing for Islam to be -- with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith -- to be part of the effort to create peace in the world.'
p520
aS'So this is a debate for peace.'
p521
aS'Its a debate, and Im asking you all to vote tonight not for Islam, but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace.'
p522
aS'Because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred.'
p523
aS'I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace.'
p524
aS'In fact, I used to believe that Islam mandates war.'
p525
aS'I used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest.'
p526
aS'I called it jihad.'
p527
aS'I believed that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison when I was 28 years old.'
p528
aS'By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributed to its growth in Egypt.'
p529
aS'But I learned in prison two things.'
p530
aS'One was what Im appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch, it does work.'
p531
aS'People Id considered my enemy, people Id considered the enemy of my people, Amnesty International with their advocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims, adopted me as a prisoner of conscience.'
p532
aS'And by handing me that olive branch, I recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless of the provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate.'
p533
aS'And thats what Im asking you to do here tonight.'
p534
aS'Because by redefining the debate, and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me, they changed my heart.'
p535
aS'I went on and took that message forward and helped establish the worlds first counter-extremism think tank in the West, then went into Pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan.'
p536
aS'And as I said, we had 10,000 supporters before wed even launched, of Muslims in Pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack Islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that this should be a world of war, not just Islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds.'
p537
aS'Whether thats because they want to fight or because they dont believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis.'
p538
aS'And so I make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate.'
p539
aS'And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that I had the opportunity -- I wont say good fortune because it wasnt really that -- but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an Egyptian prison, ironically built by the British.'
p540
aS'And what I learned was that I had been extremely arrogant.'
p541
aS'I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in my respected colleagues presentation.'
p542
aS'I had failed to contextualize history, and when I was this young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, whod been stabbed at multiple times growing up on the streets of Essex, who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man.'
p543
aS'But I went to men in prison, who had been in prison since I was three years old, and then I met them at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didnt understand that true Islam was a religion of war.'
p544
aS'And they said to me, Young lad, come and sit down.'
p545
aS'Well tell you a story or two.'
p546
aS'And over the course of the four years, after having learned Arabic, after having memorized half of the Koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not being too much of a religious man, I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism, the modern ideology that owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions of Islam.'
p547
aS"And these former jihadists, among them the assassins of Egypt's former president, Anwar Sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions."
p548
aS'And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote to help us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change.'
p549
aS"And that's exactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past."
p550
aS'Thank you for your patience, and thank you for your time.'

aS'I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace.'
p577
aS'In fact, I used to believethat Islam mandates war.'
p578
aS'I used to believe and propagate across the world in more thanthree countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that willhave at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest.'
p579
aS'I called it jihad.'
p580
aS'Ibelieved that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 yearsold and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison whenI was 28 years old.By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributedto its growth in Egypt.But I learned in prison two things.'
p581
aS'One was what Im appealing to you today and thatwas when people hold out an olive branch, it does work.'
p582
aS'People Id considered myenemy, people Id considered the enemy of my people, Amnesty International with theiradvocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims,adopted me as a prisoner of conscience.'
p583
aS'And by handing me that olive branch, Irecognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless ofthe provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and arestill willing to redefine the debate.And thats what Im asking you to do here tonight.'
p584
aS'Because by redefining the debate, andby insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which theyviewed me, they changed my heart.'
p585
aS'I went on and took that message forward and helpedestablish the worlds first counter-extremism think tank in the West, then went intoPakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan.'
p586
aS'Andas I said, we had 10,000 supporters before wed even launched, of Muslims in Pakistanwho are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority ofextremists to hijack Islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that thisshould be a world of war, not just Islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from ourco-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds.Whether thats because they want to fight or because they dont believe in religions andthey wish to challenge religions from that basis.'
p587
aS'And so I make an appeal to all of youtonight to help us redefine this debate.And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind wasthat I had the opportunity -- I wont say good fortune because it wasnt really that -- butthe opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside anEgyptian prison, ironically built by the British.'
p588
aS'And what I learned was that I had beenextremely arrogant.'
p589
aS'I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in myrespected colleagues presentation.'
p590
aS'I had failed to contextualize history, and when I wasthis young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, whod been stabbed atmultiple times growing up on the streets of Essex, who had been falsely arrested on anumber of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man.'
p591
aS'But Iwent to men in prison, who had been in prison since I was three years old, and then I metthem at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had thearrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didnt understand thattrue Islam was a religion of war.'
p592
aS'And they said to me, Young lad, come and sit down.Well tell you a story or two.And over the course of the four years, after having learned Arabic, after havingmemorized half of the Koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not beingtoo much of a religious man, I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked andabused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism, the modern ideologythat owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions ofIslam.'
p593
aS"And these former jihadists, among them the assassins of Egypt's former president,Anwar Sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions.And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote tohelp us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing toaccept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change."
p594
aS"And that'sexactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they werefaced with such situations in the past."

p654
aS"I'm not sure it is about paradigms."
p655
aS"I think it's about facts."
p656
aS'Here are some facts.'
p657
aS"In my newspaper earlier, the Times Square Bomber, of course, a man just up the road from here, who tried to kill thousands of people, only, by the way, didn't manage it because he set the 24-hour timing device at 7:00 a.m. instead of 7:00 p.m., 1900 hours was what it was meant to be."

aS'I turn to another page of the newspaper, in the city I had just flown off from this morning, a Muslim London Underground worker who was -- had written to his wife who was off to - - tried to become a martyr for Allah, as he said.'
p661
aS'He said, More than anything I wish Allah to grant me martyrdom.'
p662
aS'" Ladies and gentlemen, we have to look at facts.'
p663
aS"We should also, just quickly -- if I may refer something to the wording of tonight's debate, Ayaan's already mentioned it."
p664
aS'But let me put it this way.'
p665
aS"You're, I'm sure, a liberal minded New York audience."
p666
aS'At least I hope you are.'
p667
aS'We will see.'
p668
aS'But I imagine that if the motion we had here tonight was Christianity is a religion of peace, we get to the Q and A, perhaps even before, and somebody would say if the other side were arguing for that, somebody would say, "What about the crusades, hmm?'
p669
aS'What about that?'
p670
aS'" Then there\'d be some other Clever Clarks who\'d say, I -- what about that Florida pastor the other week?'
p671
aS'There was a nasty business.'
p672
aS"That's Christianity for you."
p673
aS"If we'd have had tonight Judaism is a religion of peace, the other side would try to argue that."
p674
aS"Sure as anything, there'd be people popping up in the hall tonight saying, Oh, there's this bit in one of the Old Testament books, really, really bad, all sorts of massacres going on."
p675
aS"Why don't you talk about that?"
p676
aS"There might even be people trying to say that religion -- the argument that Judaism was a religion of peace couldn't be argued because people would say look at what Israel is doing."
p677
aS"And isn't that a direct , and so on."
p678
aS"So let's not have a debate about Islam and whether or not Islam is a religion of peace without talking about the facts to do with Islam."
p679
aS"It's an absurd situation we're in, where nothing that anyone does whilst being Muslim is any responsibility of Islam."
p680
aS'Yet anything anyone does whilst being a Christian or a Jew is the responsibility of all Christians, all Jews.'
p681
aS"Let's make this as straightforward as I can."
p682
aS'Take the categorization that eminent scholars like Bernard Lewis and Ibn Warraq have made.'
p683
aS"Let's say Islam is a very, very complex thing."
p684
aS'And the best way I can do this in the very short time I have, is say you have three Islams, Islam one, two, and three.'
p685
aS'Islam one, the Koran and the life of Mohammad and the Hadith.'
p686
aS'Islam two, the tradition of the Sharia.'
p687
aS'Islam three, what Muslims do now.'
p688
aS'The first of those things, Islam, the Koran and so on, is bad.'
p689
aS'It is bad.'
p690
aS'There is a lot of violence in it.'
p691
aS"And what's worse, the peaceful verses are superseded by the violent verses."
p692
aS'The violent verses also sadly are more numerous in number.'
p693
aS"Then you've got the life of Mohammad."
p694
aS'Again, a bad man, a very bad man.'
p695
aS'It happens to be that not a great role model if you look at it.'
p696
aS'Takes child brides, abuses a small girl, multiple wives, himself a warrior, himself a war criminal, himself beheads Jews.'
p697
aS'This, I would have thought, would be a signal of not great peacefulness.'
p698
aS"Then you've got the tradition of the Sharia, again, not great peacefulness, still no schools of Sharia that people in this hall would want to submit to."
p699
aS'And thirdly, what Muslims do now.'
p700
aS'Thankfully, there is some hope in that one, because most Muslims, thank goodness -- I almost said thank God, but -- old habits die-hard.'
p701
aS"Most Muslims don't do what those texts say because they exercise their judgment as moral beings without having to refer to defunct holy books."
p702
aS'Now, look, I wish that Zeba and Maajid were the spokespeople of Islam.'
p703
aS'It would be lovely.'
p704
aS"Although in Maajid's case, it would have taken rather too long if everyone had to go 14 years of preaching the downfall of America and then said no, not so much."
p705
aS'But we are where we are.'
p706
aS'Anyhow, I wish they spoke for Islam.'
p707
aS'It would be great.'
p708
aS"But the fact is that tonight, the organizers of this debate asked a number of clerics, none of them which showed, specifically they wouldn't show and debate against Ayaan Hirsi Ali."
p709
aS"Myself, I don't think they cared."
p710
aS"But no, it's very interesting."
p711
aS'They will not debate.'
p712
aS'Time and again, Muslims -- the actual leaders of your religion will not debate this.'
p713
aS'And you are left with people -- now here, the reasons why of course is the leaders of the religion show such terrible -- terrible lessons.'
p714
aS'It is not a small thing.'
p715
aS"It's not as if it were a detail."
p716
aS"It's not like a wacky Florida pastor."
p717
aS"But you've got the largest Sunni state of Saudi Arabia, the most important Sunni state in the world, the most extraordinary closed prison of a society."
p718
aS"It's not a detail."
p719
aS"It's not a one-off nut job."
p720
aS"The Shiite republic of Iran is what it is, led by the people it's led by."
p721
aS'That is not an accident.'
p722
aS"It's not a detail."
p723
aS'The thing that worries me is that although tonight we hear from the panelists here about how Islam is a religion of peace, the fact is that the people who are making the decisions in the religion, the people who are preaching the religion, the heads of that religion, people like Sheikh Qaradawi who broadcasts anti-Semitic -- the most appalling filth every week on the main network, that is the faith that is speaking for you guys.'

aS"It's to ignore reality."
p732
aS"It's to ignore very difficult but necessary facts, not paradigms, but facts."
p733
aS'To say that Islam is a religion of peace is to say something based entirely on hope.'
p734
