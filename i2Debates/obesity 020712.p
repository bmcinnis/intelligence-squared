p347
aS'" Well, let me say that I spent nine years in government, five as director of the CDC, and as you\'ve heard, four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, and I have to tell you, I would trade nothing for those nine years.'
p348

p349
aS'The people with whom I worked were special.'
p350
aS'So I am very excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity.'
p351
aS'Let me just say a few of the things I was involved in.'
p352
aS'In 1996, while director of CDC, we released a very interesting report on physical activity.'
p353
aS"It was actually released as a surgeon general's report, and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the American people, including schools no longer requiring physical education, K through 12."
p354
aS'And so we expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of American people and the implications of that.'
p355
aS'In 1999, I represented the United States at a world conference on health promotion and disease prevention.'
p356
aS"And at that conference for the first time I released the surgeon general's Prescription , which I'm sure many of you are familiar with, but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week, but also a recommendation that the American people consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day."
p357
aS'There were other things on the prescription, even one having to do with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress.'
p358
aS"We didn't really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical activity and depression, the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for reducing depression."
p359
aS"Then in 2001, as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, I released the surgeon general's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Overweight and Obesity."
p360
aS'That report, among other things, pointed out that between 1980 and the year 2000 there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a doubling among adults.'
p361
aS'So we did sound the alarm, and even though I was former director of the CDC and we are very selective at what we call "epidemics," usually reserved for infectious diseases, we declared that overweight and obesity was an epidemic in this country.'
p362
aS"We didn't realize at that time that the same thing was beginning to happen all over the world."
p363
aS'In that report of the surgeon general on overweight and obesity, we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps throughout the country, where you could actually map the increase in overweight and obesity in various states, whereas in 1990, 15 percent was almost the high.'
p364
aS'By the year 2001, it was 25 to 30 percent of the American people who were obese.'
p365
aS'What we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very important, I think, to this debate because what we know is that it has increased dramatically, but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases, especially what we call Type II diabetes, or increases in what we call BMI, the way we measure body fat, directly related to an increase in Type II diabetes.'
p366
aS'And, as you know, Type II diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease.'
p367
aS'So we were concerned about what was happening in this country.'
p368
aS'We were concerned about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity.'
p369
aS'We were also concerned about disparities.'
p370
aS'We have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in health in this country, especially among different racial and ethnic groups.'
p371
aS'And what we observed, of course, was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting African Americans and American Indians.'
p372
aS'So, American Indians also have the highest rate of Type II diabetes.'
p373
aS'And African Americans have the highest mortality rates from Type II diabetes.'
p374
aS'So we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on eliminating disparities in health.'
p375
aS'We were also concerned about what was happening in children.'
p376
aS'I think this was really critical.'
p377
aS'What we found was that children, by increasing overweight and obesity, were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset diabetes.'
p378
aS'We were seeing it in children.'

p481
aS'And at first that sounds like common sense, but everything is arguably, to some degree, helpful or harmful.'
p482
aS'So, this is a formula for totalitarianism.'
p483
aS'I mean, why is totalitarianism if not the view that everything falls within the purview of the state?'

p486

aS'They started the country with this.'

p497

p498
aS'Now, this isnt everything we should have.'
p499
aS'We need pollution control rules.'
p500
aS'They didnt think about that.'
p501
aS'But government has gone much further.'
p502
aS'We now have an agriculture department that spends $145 billion a year.'
p503
aS'Government runs public housing, a war on drugs, a welfare state.'
p504
aS'It subsidizes farmers and, by doing that, does harm, as Robert Rosenkrantz said, making people fatter.'
p505
aS'It runs school lunches.'
p506
aS'It subsidizes students, Indians, researchers, volunteers, small businessmen, rich businessmen, polices the world and polices our home and our jobs, our bedrooms.'
p507
aS'And now food too?'
p508
aS'Well, yes.'
p509
aS"But if it weren't already doing all -- trying to do all that stuff and doing it badly, it could better do what it's supposed to, protect us from criminals and terrorists."
p510
aS"And America wouldn't be going broke."
p511
aS'But look, I have lost that argument.'
p512
aS"We libertarians have argued that we're in the minority."
p513
aS'I understand that.'
p514
aS'Most of you disagree.'
p515
aS'Most of you want more government.'
p516
aS'You like the minimum wage.'
p517
aS'You like the EEOC to protect us against discrimination, Title 9 to protect us against gender discrimination, rules against sexual harassment language being used in workplaces, the ADA to protect disabled people, laws against prostitution and online gambling.'
p518
aS'And in the name of health and safety, you support laws requiring motorcycle helmets and OSHA to protect the workers, and the CSPC to protect kids from dangerous toys, and the whole alphabet soup of agencies that keep growing in Washington.'
p519
aS'And my debate partner, Paul, he agrees with that.'
p520
aS'He says government ought to intervene in these areas.'
p521
aS'But even he says not obesity, because obesity is different, and government sucks at dealing with it.'
p522
aS"But he's the obesity expert."
p523
aS"I'll let him explain that."
p524
aS'All I know is that government keeps growing, and that is dangerous to our freedom.'
p525
aS"Now the president wants to spend another 300 million or so of your dollars to pay for his wife's healthy foods financing initiative."
p526
aS'And of course, that\'s in addition to all the stuff we already have, the "let\'s move" campaign, the task force on childhood obesity, the school lunch program, the council on fitness and so on.'
p527
aS"What's the result of all that stuff?"
p528
aS'Since they created it, they spent a lot of your money on it, people are fatter than ever.'
p529
aS"And that's just what the Feds spend."
p530
aS'The states and localities spend even more.'
p531
aS'I mean, New York City now bans bake sales in schools.'
p532
aS'How much has that helped?'
p533
aS"My colleague, Mike Huckabee when he was governor of Arkansas, he required every school to measure every kid's body mass index."
p534
aS'Dr. Satcher mentioned that.'
p535
aS"It's a measure based on the height-weight ratio."
p536
aS"It's a terrible measure."
p537
aS'I mean, BMI index says that George Clooney and Tom Cruise are overweight and Arnold Schwarzenegger is obese.'
p538
aS"It just mismeasures people, but it's required now in Arkansas."
p539
aS"For every kid, they get a report card that doesn't just give their arithmetic score."
p540
aS'It tells the parents what their BMI index is.'
p541
aS'The result?'
p542
aS"Well, I don't think it's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted."
p543
aS'But the kids are just as fat.'
p544
aS"It's made no difference in obesity in the schools."
p545
aS'Some states say, we ought to have some taxes, taxes on bad food.'
p546
aS'And intuitively, this makes sense.'
p547
aS"Let's tax candy and, oh, then they'll eat less candy."
p548
aS"They'll eat more fruits and vegetables."
p549
aS'So Illinois did that.'
p550
aS'Six percent tax on candy.'
p551
aS"But what's the result?"
p552
aS"It's just confusing."
p553
aS'What is candy?'
p554
aS"They decide, okay, a Hershey bar is candy, but a Kit Kat bar, that's food because it's got flower in it."
p555
aS"So this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers, but it doesn't help anybody lose weight."
p556
aS'In New York City, the government requires calorie counts now to be posted in restaurants.'
p557
aS'And that makes sense.'
p558
aS'Information is good.'
p559
aS'So NYU did a study of that and found that, yes, adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings.'
p560
aS'But then they checked the receipts, and they found the people ordered slightly more calories.'
p561
aS"Government can't make us thinner."
p562
aS"Government can't control our personal behavior in that way."
p563
aS"And even if it could, we're spending $3.8 trillion going broke."
p564
aS"We couldn't afford to do this even if it worked."
p565
aS"We don't need government to do this."
p566
aS'There are only two ways to do things in life: voluntary or force.'
p567
aS'Government is force.'
p568
aS'We need some force to keep us safe.'
p569
aS'But voluntary is better.'
p570
aS'And voluntary abounds.'
p571
aS'We have plenty of diet information.'
p572
aS'All these diet websites, books on nutrition, TV shows like The Biggest Loser, diet gurus are celebrities.'
p573
aS"That's enough."
p574
aS"We don't need government taking our money, and we don't need government force."

p629
aS"What's the result ofall that stuff?"
p630
aS'Since they created it, they spent a lot of your money on it, people arefatter than ever.'
p631
aS"And that's just what the Feds spend.The states and localities spend even more."
p632
aS'I mean, New York City now bans bake salesin schools.'
p633
aS'How much has that helped?'
p634
aS"My colleague, Mike Huckabee when he wasgovernor of Arkansas, he required every school to measure every kid's body mass index.Dr."
p635
aS'Satcher mentioned that.'
p636
aS"It's a measure based on the height-weight ratio."
p637
aS"It's aterrible measure."
p638
aS'I mean, BMI index says that George Clooney and Tom Cruise areoverweight and Arnold Schwarzenegger is obese.'
p639
aS"It just mismeasures people, but it'srequired now in Arkansas."
p640
aS"For every kid, they get a report card that doesn't just givetheir arithmetic score."
p641
aS'It tells the parents what their BMI index is.'
p642
aS'The result?'
p643
aS"Well, Idon't think it's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted."
p644
aS'Butthe kids are just as fat.'
p645
aS"It's made no difference in obesity in the schools."
p646
aS'Some statessay, we ought to have some taxes, taxes on bad food.'
p647
aS"And intuitively, this makes sense.Let's tax candy and, oh, then they'll eat less candy."
p648
aS"They'll eat more fruits andvegetables.So Illinois did that."
p649
aS'Six percent tax on candy.'
p650
aS"But what's the result?"
p651
aS"It's just confusing.What is candy?"
p652
aS"They decide, okay, a Hershey bar is candy, but a Kit Kat bar, that's foodbecause it's got flower in it.So this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers, but it doesn't help anybody lose [[laughter]] weight."
p653
aS'In New York City, the government requires calorie counts now to be posted inrestaurants.'
p654
aS'And that makes sense.'
p655
aS'Information is good.'
p656
aS'So NYU did a study of that andfound that, yes, adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings.'
p657
aS"But then theychecked the receipts, and they found the people ordered slightly more calories.Government can't make us thinner."
p658
aS"Government can't control our personal behavior inthat way."
p659
aS"And even if it could, we're spending $3.8 trillion going broke.We couldn't afford to do this even if it worked."
p660
aS"We don't need government to do this.There are only two ways to do things in life: voluntary or force."
p661
aS'Government is force.We need some force to keep us safe.'
p662
aS'But voluntary is better.'
p663
aS'And voluntary abounds.We have plenty of diet information.'
p664
aS'All these diet websites, books on nutrition, TVshows like The Biggest Loser, diet gurus are celebrities.'
p665
aS"That's enough."
p666

p913
aS"I think that the fundamental difficulty here is that, despite the great courtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me, I'd like to start by pointing out that this debate is framed in completely the wrong way."
p914
aS'To have a motion that says, "Obesity is the government\'s business," essentially begs the question because using the term "obesity" frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathological state of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they\'re obese or above 25 if they\'re overweight.'
p915
aS'And that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as being per se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state.'
p916
aS'Imagine if this debate were framed as, "Eliminating body diversity is the government\'s business.'
p917
aS'" I think that would sound a lot different, but in point of fact there is really -- there is no practical distinction between those two motions.'
p918
aS'The assumptions at work here are that a narrow range of body weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is the product of poor lifestyle.'
p919
aS"Furthermore, it's assumed in the framing of this issue that by reforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively, you can eliminate abnormal body weight."
p920
aS'This is all wrong.'
p921
aS"There's nothing normal about normal body weight."
p922
aS"It's not normal statistically."
p923
aS"It's not normal epidemiologically."
p924
aS"The overweight category of BMI 25 to 29.9 does not, in fact, feature increased overall health risk, so there isn't even a correlation there between increased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state."
p925
aS"The vast majority of people, and I'm going to say this about 27 times tonight, cannot intentionally modify their body mass in a long term fashion successfully."
p926
aS'There is no better established proposition empirically in all of medicine than that.'
p927
aS'In other words, people, as you all know -- well, I shouldn\'t say "all of you," but many of you know from personal experience -- find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significant long term way voluntarily.'
p928
aS'Government intervention in this area, and my partner, John Stossel is quite correct in saying that.'
p929
aS'In comparison to him, I am almost a Stalinist in my enthusiasm for government intervention, although I think he did overstate a couple of my positions.'
p930
aS'I wont get into those because thats beside the point.'
p931
aS'But in fact, even though I am generally enthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread, I am in fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because I think government -- the same as -- obesity as governments business is almost a kind of dream scenario for a Libertarian.'
p932
aS'Because a Libertarian could not come up with a better example of government dysfunction than of the notion that were supposed to make people thinner, mainly because -- well, for a bunch of reasons, which I want to go through quickly right now and then come back to later.'
p933

aS"I think that the fundamental difficulty here is that, despite the greatcourtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me, I'd like to start by pointing outthat this debate is framed in completely the wrong way."
p978
aS'To have a motion that says,"Obesity is the government\'s business," essentially begs the question because using theterm "obesity" frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathologicalstate of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they\'re obese or above 25 ifthey\'re overweight.And that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as beingper se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state.'
p979
aS'Imagine if this debate wereframed as, "Eliminating body diversity is the government\'s business.'
p980
aS'" I think that wouldsound a lot different, but in point of fact there is really -- there is no practical distinctionbetween those two motions.'
p981
aS'The assumptions at work here are that a narrow range ofbody weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is theproduct of poor lifestyle.'
p982
aS"Furthermore, it's assumed in the framing of this issue that byreforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively, you can eliminateabnormal body weight."
p983
aS"This is all wrong.There's nothing normal about normal body weight."
p984
aS"It's not normal statistically."
p985
aS"It's notnormal epidemiologically."
p986
aS"The overweight category of BMI 25 to 29.9 does not, in fact,feature increased overall health risk, so there isn't even a correlation there betweenincreased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state."
p987
aS"The vast majority ofpeople, and I'm going to say this about 27 times tonight, cannot intentionally modifytheir body mass in a long term fashion successfully."
p988
aS'There is no better establishedproposition empirically in all of medicine than that.'
p989
aS'In other words, people, as you allknow -- well, I shouldn\'t say "all of you," but many of you know from personalexperience -- find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significantlong term way voluntarily.'
p990
aS'Government intervention in this area, and my partner, JohnStossel is quite correct in saying that.In comparison to him, I am almost a Stalinist in my enthusiasm for governmentintervention, although I think he did overstate a couple of my positions.'
p991
aS'I wont get intothose because thats beside the point.'
p992
aS'But in fact, even though I am generallyenthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread, I amin fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because I thinkgovernment -- the same as -- obesity as governments business is almost a kind of dreamscenario for a Libertarian.'
p993
aS'Because a Libertarian could not come up with a betterexample of government dysfunction than of the notion that were supposed to makepeople thinner, mainly because -- well, for a bunch of reasons, which I want to gothrough quickly right now and then come back to later.Here I want to emphasize first of all that we do not know an enormous number of thingsthat we would have to know if we were going to have a rational policy that was basedon the notion that we were going to make everybody have a BMI between 18.5 and24.9, the so-called normal range, which for an average height woman would bebetween 108 and 144 pounds, outside of that supposedly pathological.'

S"Well, let me say that I have seen government at its worst and I've seen government at its best."

aS'I grew up in Alabama at a time of segregation and discrimination.'
p3822
aS'I was a teenager when George Wallace, running for governor, came to town and said that he would deputize every white man in Alabama before he would see one black child go to the University of Alabama.'
p3823
aS"I've seen government at its worst."
p3824
aS"But I've also seen government at its best."
p3825
aS"I've seen government protect children from lead."
p3826
aS'As a medical student I saw babies coming into emergency room with toxicity from lead.'
p3827
aS'Many of them died.'
p3828
aS"That was in the '60s."
p3829
aS"In 1978, the government regulated the lead content of house paint, and we've seen a dramatic decline in lead poisoning in children."
p3830
aS"I've seen government at its best."
p3831
aS"I've been involved in the eradication of polio, and all over the world, and recently learned that last year for the first time not one child in India suffered from polio."
p3832
aS'And only three countries in the world have polio, a total of less than 700 cases in the world.'
p3833
aS'Government at its best is "We, the people.'
p3834
aS'" Government is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.'
p3835
aS"So that's what we see as government."
p3836
aS'We believe that there is no substitute for individual responsibility.'
p3837
aS"Let's make that clear."
p3838
aS"It's why I wrote the prescription."
p3839
aS'But individual responsibility can only take place in an environment where there is equal opportunity, there is equal access to the opportunity for a healthy lifestyle.'
p3840
aS"It's our contention that obesity is the business of the government because it is the business of the government to create those conditions."
