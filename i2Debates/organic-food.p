p94
aS'So I hope that you will understandwhat I am saying even though I am speaking the English that occurs on the other side ofthe pond.'
p95
aS'Let me explain first of all where Im coming from in this.'
p96
aS'As the former head ofthe Food Standards Agency, I am not anti organic, absolutely not anti organic.'
p97
aS'But what Iam is pro accurate consumer information, I am pro healthy eating, and I am pro scientificdispassionate analysis of the facts.'
p98
aS'Ive got no vested interest.'
p99
aS'It makes no difference tome whether or not you eat organic food, but I do sometimes get angry about themarketing hype.And let me give you a for instance.'
p100
aS'Just last week I was watching a television show aboutdiet and health, and on the show there was a woman who was working for a low income,and she had three children, and she said to the interviewer, I feel really guilty because Icannot afford the organic food to feed my children a healthy diet.'
p101
aS'And that made mereally cross, because she didnt need to buy organic food to feed her children a healthydiet, although -- according to the surveys -- six in ten Americans who buy organic foodbelieve theyre getting a healthier option.'
p102
aS'And they are paying for it, because when yougo shopping, if you buy organic food, you spend $1.60 for every dollar you would haveto spend buying exactly the equivalent food produced conventionally.'
p103
aS'So, is it worthpaying the extra for health benefits?'
p104
aS'The answer is a plain, straightforward, simple no.Why do I say that?'
p105
aS'I say that because Ive scrutinized the evidence.'
p106
aS'Now if you look at [[applause]] the evidence, you have to ask yourselves two questions: who is saying it, and why arethey saying it?'
p107
aS'And of course, if you listen to the organic sector that has a vested interest,they will pick and choose the evidence that supports their case, and no doubt well hearthat later on this evening.'
p108
aS'But I prefer to believe those groups of people who areindependent, impartial, objective groups of scientists put together by official agencies tostudy the evidence with no side one way or the other.'
p109
aS'And its not just the U.K.Standards Agency that John referred, but at the last count, in eight different countrieswhere the federal or national agencies have looked at this issue, in every case they havecome to the same conclusion: there is no health benefit of eating organic food whencompared with conventional food.'
p110
aS'Furthermore, and this is a really important point, inthe U.K. we have an advertizing standards watchdog, and a few years ago they penalizedour two major supermarket chains for advertizing and claiming that organic food ishealthier, and they were stopped.Those supermarket chains were stopped from making that claim.'
p111
aS'And note this: they didnot come back with a legal challenge.'
p112
aS'Why did they not come back with a legalchallenge?'
p113
aS'Because there was no case to defend.'
p114
aS'There was no evident to support theircase that would stand up in a court of law.'
p115
aS'So what are the supposed benefits, healthbenefits of organic food?'
p116
aS'Some people think that its more nutritious, that it may containmore of those essential micronutrients, vitamins, or antioxidants that are supposed toprotect us against cancer.'
p117
aS'But when you look at all the evidence together, sometimesorganic food does contain more, sometimes it contains less, but taking the picture in theround, there is no -- absolutely no -- consistent difference.'
p118
aS'What about safety of food?Because some people say, Well maybe I ought not to take the risk.'
p119
aS'Organic food ismore natural.'
p120
aS'Its safer.'
p121
aS'And indeed in Britain 70 percent of the baby food sold isorganic because parents are worried about what theyre feeding their children.'
p122
aS'Well whatare these safety issues?'
p123
aS'One thing that people are concerned about is pesticide residues.Maybe the vegetables or the fruit thats been sprayed in a conventional farm leave tinyresidues on the surface that you may eat when you consume those vegetables.'
p124
aS'Well twothings to note.'
p125
aS'First of all, organic farmers also use pesticides.'
p126
aS'They just use a differentset of pesticides.'
p127
aS'But secondly, and more important, those residues are they -- when theyare present -- in such minute quantities that they are harmless relative to the naturaldangerous chemicals that occur in all the food you eat.'
p128
aS'How many of you have everdrunk a cup of coffee?'
p129
aS'Raise your hands.Okay.'
p130
aS'Quite a few of you have drunk a cup of coffee.'
p131
aS'Well let me tell you, in that one [[laughter]] cup of coffee there are more carcinogens that you would get in all the pesticide residuesin eating conventionally produced or organically produced fruit and vegetables for awhole year.So if youre worried about potential carcinogens in your food, dont drink that cup ofcoffee.'
p132
aS'But of course, you dont need to worry, because these chemicals may have thepotential to be dangerous, but they are in such a low level in the food that you dont needto worry about it.'
p133
aS'But in a way, this is missing the point, because you can argue hitherand thither about how much of this chemical is in the food, how much of that pesticideresidue is present, how much of this vitamin, and so on.'
p134
aS'What really counts is looking atthe health outcomes.'
p135
aS'So, are people who eat organic food healthier than people whodont?'
p136
aS'And thats a pretty difficult question to answer, but there is one study thatslooked at it, and its an extremely large study.'
p137
aS'Its called the Million Women Study.'
p138
aS'Itsbeing carried out in the U.K., and its called the Million Women Study, because itinvolves at least one million women who over a long time period record everything abouttheir lifestyle, including what they eat, and subject themselves to a variety of healthmeasures, including suffering from diseases.'
p139
aS'And that study shows that there is nodifference in the health outcomes for women that eat organic food and women that donteat organic food.'
p140
aS'It doesnt really matter to me whether you eat organic food or not.'
p141
aS'Itsyour lifestyle choice.'
p142
aS'It doesnt bring you any benefit.'
p143
aS'But what does matter to me iswhen poor people, like that woman I saw on television, feel guilty because theyre notfeeding their kids organic food.'
p144
aS'Just because of the marketing hype, they feel guilty, andthat, to me, is an outrage.'
p145
aS'So, I urge you to vote for the motion at the end of this evening.'

p251
aS'Id like to address a few things that John brought upin this resolution, and the first thing is the resolution is not about whether organic ishealthier or not.'
p252
aS'Thats not what were debating today.'
p253
aS'Were also not debating whetherits more nutritious.'
p254
aS'What were debating is whether its marketing hype or not, and thatis what were trying to judge by the end of this debate.'
p255
aS'John brought up a few things thatIm going to address, including pesticide residues and sort of dismissing any level ofharm whatsoever.'
p256
aS'And if youre eating carcinogens in one thing, why not eat it ineverything?'
p257
aS'That is simply a dangerous -- dangerous theory.'
p258
aS'And as a toxicologist forConsumer Reports, I have to say that we barely understand what one chemical does atone point in time.'
p259
aS'We have no idea what the multiple exposures to low-level pesticides ---- chemicals, drugs, heavy metals does to anybody, and so, as a mother of two, and as [[applause]] many people are, if you have the health of somebody elses hands in your hands andyoure responsible for them, you want to take extra measures to figure out what youreputting in their bodies, too.'
p260
aS'Ill leave that now and Im going to launch into our side ofthe case, which is that Consumer Reports has been deciphering labels since 1936.'
p261
aS'Oursole mission is to educate consumers about marketing hype, what it is, what it isnt.'
p262
aS'Andfor many years, I have to say in my last 10 years rating labels weve come across a lot oflabels that are marketing hype.Natural: very few standards, no verification.'
p263
aS'Hypoallergenic: also marketing hype, nostandards.'
p264
aS'Fragrance-free, free range.'
p265
aS'All of those labels are marketing hype.'
p266
aS'They haveno standards.'
p267
aS'They have no verification.'
p268
aS'Those are our two most important criteria whenwere rating labels, and those dont meet any of them.'
p269
aS'On the other hand, organic foodmeets those criteria.'
p270
aS'It does have a comprehensive set of standards behind them, and it isverified.'
p271
aS'We dont consider that to be marketing hype, and therefore we think you shouldvote against this resolution.'
p272
aS'So, let me give you some more examples of marketing hype.Wonder Bread, wonder brains.'
p273
aS'They had that out for a while.'
p274
aS'FTC took action againstthat, that they cant call it that.'
p275
aS'Maybe some of you recall the Smart Choices labelprogram, a big green check mark that was industry sponsored, ConAgra, Pepsi.'
p276
aS'Youfound it all over, including Fruit Loops, full fat mayonnaise, a couple other things.'
p277
aS'Thatsalso marketing hype.'
p278
aS'Not such a smart choice.'
p279
aS'And one other one: the United EggProducers used to have a claim called Animal Care Certified.'
p280
aS'Sounds really lovely likethe animals were cared for, but it could have been used on eggs that came from chickensstuffed in the battery cages where they couldnt stand up, put into towers of battery cageswhere all their poop and excrement basically rained down through the cages onto thefloor, contaminating the ground, moving into the ground water: could be labeled AnimalCare Certified.'
p281
aS'They stopped doing that, but, again, thats another example of whatsmarketing hype.'
p282
aS'Incidentally, organic production doesnt allow chickens to be stuffed inthose battery cages, and its just one of the reasons why organic offers a benefit overconventional.'
p283
aS'Let me jump into five other big reasons why organic does carry morevalue, and first of all just to set the stage, Congress passed an act in 1990, the OrganicFood Production Act.'
p284
aS'The USDA runs the National Organic Program.'
p285
aS'We havecertifiers and inspectors accredited by the USDA.This is a public program.'
p286
aS'Everybody can participate in it.'
p287
aS'And, it is subject toaccountability, it is subject to inspection itself.'
p288
aS'This is a credible labeling program.'
p289
aS'Idont think were really wasting this much energy over something that is just simplymarketing hype.'
p290
aS'But lets get into five big reasons why organic offers benefit overconventional production.'
p291
aS'First of all, organic animals eat a diet free of poop.'
p292
aS'Can youbelieve that?'
p293
aS'Why am I saying that?'
p294

aS'Antibiotic resistance is a huge growing public health problem in thiscountry.We feed antibiotics to animals every single day.'
p303

p304

p305
aS'Why do we do it in conventionalagriculture?'
p306
aS'Number two reason why organic offers a benefit.'
p307
aS'Third, we feed animals --chicken broilers in this country -- things like arsenic, if you can believe it.'
p308
aS'These aretoxic heavy metals that we actually feed the animals.'
p309
aS'They act a lot like antibiotics.They help them grow better, they help prevent disease.'
p310
aS'And yet, the arsenic goes fromtheir poop into the ground, it seeps into the ground, and the problem with conventional agis people dont think it moves anywhere.'
p311
aS'But it does.'
p312
aS'It moves into the ground, into thegroundwater.'
p313
aS'We create big pits of manure that go up into the air and contaminate it.These things are controlled for in organic production.'
p314
aS'Two last things.'
p315
aS'Organic doesnt [[applause]] allow the use of most synthetic pesticides.'
p316
aS'Its true, as John points out, that somepesticides are allowed, but one report estimates that about 60 percent of the pesticidesthat are out there are classified as a known, probably, or possible carcinogen.'
p317
aS'If you canhave food that doesnt have those things, why wouldnt you want to eat healthier?'
p318
aS'Whywouldnt that offer a benefit?'
p319
aS'But remember, this isnt a debate about whether you wouldbuy it, but rather whether it is truly a measurable difference and whether it offers acredible alternative to consumers who are buying it, and whether or not consumers whobuy organic are currently being deceived in the marketplace.'

p339
aS'Id like to address a few things that John brought up in this resolution, and the first thing is the resolution is not about whether organic is healthier or not.'
p340
aS'Thats not what were debating today.'
p341
aS'Were also not debating whether its more nutritious.'
p342
aS'What were debating is whether its marketing hype or not, and that is what were trying to judge by the end of this debate.'
p343
aS'John brought up a few things that Im going to address, including pesticide residues and sort of dismissing any level of harm whatsoever.'
p344
aS'And if youre eating carcinogens in one thing, why not eat it in everything?'
p345
aS'That is simply a dangerous -- dangerous theory.'
p346
aS'And as a toxicologist for Consumer Reports, I have to say that we barely understand what one chemical does at one point in time.'
p347
aS'We have no idea what the multiple exposures to low-level pesticides -- -- chemicals, drugs, heavy metals does to anybody, and so, as a mother of two, and as many people are, if you have the health of somebody elses hands in your hands and youre responsible for them, you want to take extra measures to figure out what youre putting in their bodies, too.'
p348
aS'Ill leave that now and Im going to launch into our side of the case, which is that Consumer Reports has been deciphering labels since 1936.'
p349
aS'Our sole mission is to educate consumers about marketing hype, what it is, what it isnt.'
p350
aS'And for many years, I have to say in my last 10 years rating labels weve come across a lot of labels that are marketing hype.'
p351
aS'Natural: very few standards, no verification.'
p352
aS'Hypoallergenic: also marketing hype, no standards.'
p353
aS'Fragrance-free, free range.'
p354
aS'All of those labels are marketing hype.'
p355
aS'They have no standards.'
p356
aS'They have no verification.'
p357
aS'Those are our two most important criteria when were rating labels, and those dont meet any of them.'
p358
aS'On the other hand, organic food meets those criteria.'
p359
aS'It does have a comprehensive set of standards behind them, and it is verified.'
p360
aS'We dont consider that to be marketing hype, and therefore we think you should vote against this resolution.'
p361
aS'So, let me give you some more examples of marketing hype.'
p362
aS'Wonder Bread, wonder brains.'
p363
aS'They had that out for a while.'
p364
aS'FTC took action against that, that they cant call it that.'
p365
aS'Maybe some of you recall the Smart Choices label program, a big green check mark that was industry sponsored, ConAgra, Pepsi.'
p366
aS'You found it all over, including Fruit Loops, full fat mayonnaise, a couple other things.'
p367
aS'Thats also marketing hype.'
p368
aS'Not such a smart choice.'
p369
aS'And one other one: the United Egg Producers used to have a claim called Animal Care Certified.'
p370
aS'Sounds really lovely like the animals were cared for, but it could have been used on eggs that came from chickens stuffed in the battery cages where they couldnt stand up, put into towers of battery cages where all their poop and excrement basically rained down through the cages onto the floor, contaminating the ground, moving into the ground water: could be labeled Animal Care Certified.'
p371
aS'They stopped doing that, but, again, thats another example of whats marketing hype.'
p372
aS'Incidentally, organic production doesnt allow chickens to be stuffed in those battery cages, and its just one of the reasons why organic offers a benefit over conventional.'
p373
aS'Let me jump into five other big reasons why organic does carry more value, and first of all just to set the stage, Congress passed an act in 1990, the Organic Food Production Act.'
p374
aS'The USDA runs the National Organic Program.'
p375
aS'We have certifiers and inspectors accredited by the USDA.'
p376
aS'This is a public program.'
p377
aS'Everybody can participate in it.'
p378
aS'And, it is subject to accountability, it is subject to inspection itself.'
p379
aS'This is a credible labeling program.'
p380
aS'I dont think were really wasting this much energy over something that is just simply marketing hype.'
p381
aS'But lets get into five big reasons why organic offers benefit over conventional production.'
p382
aS'First of all, organic animals eat a diet free of poop.'
p383
aS'Can you believe that?'
p384
aS'Why am I saying that?'
p385
aS'Am I a nutball?'
p386
aS'But no, conventional agriculture and conventional farming in this country actually picks up chicken litter from the bottom of the chicken coop, filled with poop, excrement, whatever that chicken ate -- including mammalian byproducts, cow brain, blood meal -- and guess what?'
p387
aS'Animals eat that in conventional production.'
p388
aS'It also can include garbage, plastic roughage pellets, and this is the stuff that we freely -- in face, we call it a rich protein supplement.'
p389
aS'I mean, this is a protein considered useful for animal feeding.'
p390
aS'Its not allowed in organic production.'
p391
aS'Its just one reason why organic offers a benefit.'
p392
aS'Second, organic is free of antibiotics; they cannot be used.'

aS'These are toxic heavy metals that we actually feed the animals.'

aS'We create big pits of manure that go up into the air and contaminate it.'

p635
aS'So that was lopsided and have always been lopsided, so much so that the other side was emboldened to move that it should be a crime for a milk producer to announce that there was no bovine somatotropin hormone in his milk because that would be marketing hype since theres no difference.'

p826
aS'First of all, I think I need to start with an apology to myesteemed colleagues on the pro side of this debate, because Im actually going to speak tothe motion.'
p827
aS'Tonight were debating whether organic food is marketing hype, and the waythat I understood this -- and I think probably most of the people on our side -- is thatwere talking about the companies and the farmers that grow organic food and sell it topeople.'
p828
aS'They put claims on the label.'
p829
aS'There is advertizing, theres lots of information onwebsites.'
p830
aS'I think we all have a pretty good idea on how companies market products anddeliver information to consumers.'
p831
aS'And in the United States, as you know, there is anumber of laws and regulations that govern what is marketing hype and whats not.Urvashi spoke to some of that.'
p832
aS'Weve all heard the saying one aspirin a day helps preventheart attacks.Thats kind of amazing that it does, but in large clinical trials, people that take an aspirina day have a statistically significant lower risk of heart attack, and so the FTC and theFDA have allowed that claim on -- in advertising for aspirin.'
p833
aS'But if you heard an aspirin aday prevents heart attacks, that of course would be marketing hype.'
p834
aS'To claim that it willprevent goes over the line into marketing hype.'
p835
aS'So, how do we judge whether the claimsthat are made or the information thats passed on by organic food companies crosses thisline into misinformation or materially misleading information, which is a standard in theFTC guidelines?'
p836
aS'What the government says -- now, think about the last time you went tothe supermarket.'
p837
aS'You cant walk down any aisle without leading labels that say they havereduced this or low that or a good source of this or promotes heart health or promotes eyehealth or good for your cholesterol, heart healthy, etc.'
p838
aS'All of these claims that eitherpromote a food product because theres more of something thats good or less ofsomething thats not good for you, like saturated fat or cholesterol or salt, embedded inthose claims are at least a 25 percent difference in the level of the nutrient.'
p839
aS'This is appliedfairly universally across the entire food system.'
p840
aS'So, whenever you see these labels thatsays its, you know, a good source of lycopene -- youre buying a tomato product;lycopene is a nutrient in tomatoes -- and it says a good source of lycopene, you can trustthat the company has done testing that shows that theres at least 25 percent more in theirproduct compared to others.'
p841
aS'So, as we go through the evening, keep in mind that if thereis solid scientific evidence that one food product, whether its conventional or organic,has higher or lower of a particular nutrient thats good or bad for you buy a Good or badfor you, by a 25% margin that the government allows a labeling claim to be associatedwith that.Now, how is organic food marketed?'
p842
aS'What are the principle claims?'
p843
aS"And benefits?Well, number one, of course, is organic farmers may not apply toxic synthetic pesticides.It's just a blanket prohibition."
p844
aS'The products that they can apply encompass all of thosethat post any risk to humans or the environment.'
p845
aS"It's true organic farmers request usenatural products like copper fungicides, sulfur is used to help protect diseases."
p846
aS"Naturalinsecticide, Bacilus thuringiensis that Blake talked about, it's how Monsanto and otherbiotech companies have found a way to move the capacity to produce this naturalinsecticide into the corn plants."
p847
aS'And so without a doubt the reduction in exposure andrisk from pesticides is the most common claim that you read.'
p848
aS'And there is no questionthat organic farming reduces pesticide risk.'
p849
aS"It's laughable for anybody to argue that itdoesn't."
p850
aS'You know, American agriculture, apply rounds, a billion pounds of pesticides ayear.'
p851
aS'Some are not terribly hazardous, including Glyfosate which Blake will use on someof his genetically engineered crops.'
p852
aS'But there are several other pesticides, especiallyinsecticides to do pose significant risk.'
p853
aS"And the fact that we're all exposed to pesticides,even before we're born, does play a role in our public health."
p854
aS'Do you all know that theaverage baby born in America has like 200 chemicals in its blood the moment its bornfrom the exposures to its mother?'
p855
aS'About one out of eight babies are born with adiagnosable birth defect?About a quarter of the couples in America are having trouble having babies.'
p856
aS'They needsome help in getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to term.'
p857

S'Thank you, John, very much.'
p874
aS'First of all, I think I need to start with an apology to my esteemed colleagues on the pro side of this debate, because Im actually going to speak to the motion.'
p875
aS'Tonight were debating whether organic food is marketing hype, and the way that I understood this -- and I think probably most of the people on our side -- is that were talking about the companies and the farmers that grow organic food and sell it to people.'
p876
aS'They put claims on the label.'
p877
aS'There is advertizing, theres lots of information on websites.'
p878
aS'I think we all have a pretty good idea on how companies market products and deliver information to consumers.'
p879
aS'And in the United States, as you know, there is a number of laws and regulations that govern what is marketing hype and whats not.'
p880
aS'Urvashi spoke to some of that.'
p881
aS'Weve all heard the saying one aspirin a day helps prevent heart attacks.'
p882
aS'Thats kind of amazing that it does, but in large clinical trials, people that take an aspirin a day have a statistically significant lower risk of heart attack, and so the FTC and the FDA have allowed that claim on -- in advertising for aspirin.'
p883
aS'But if you heard an aspirin a day prevents heart attacks, that of course would be marketing hype.'
p884
aS'To claim that it will prevent goes over the line into marketing hype.'
p885
aS'So, how do we judge whether the claims that are made or the information thats passed on by organic food companies crosses this line into misinformation or materially misleading information, which is a standard in the FTC guidelines?'
p886
aS'What the government says -- now, think about the last time you went to the supermarket.'
p887
aS'You cant walk down any aisle without leading labels that say they have reduced this or low that or a good source of this or promotes heart health or promotes eye health or good for your cholesterol, heart healthy, etc.'
p888
aS'All of these claims that either promote a food product because theres more of something thats good or less of something thats not good for you, like saturated fat or cholesterol or salt, embedded in those claims are at least a 25 percent difference in the level of the nutrient.'
p889
aS'This is applied fairly universally across the entire food system.'
p890
aS'So, whenever you see these labels that says its, you know, a good source of lycopene -- youre buying a tomato product; lycopene is a nutrient in tomatoes -- and it says a good source of lycopene, you can trust that the company has done testing that shows that theres at least 25 percent more in their product compared to others.'
p891
aS'So, as we go through the evening, keep in mind that if there is solid scientific evidence that one food product, whether its conventional or organic, has higher or lower of a particular nutrient thats good or bad for you buy a Good or bad for you, by a 25% margin that the government allows a labeling claim to be associated with that.'
p892
aS'Now, how is organic food marketed?'
p893
aS'What are the principle claims?'
p894
aS'And benefits?'
p895
aS'Well, number one, of course, is organic farmers may not apply toxic synthetic pesticides.'
p896
aS"It's just a blanket prohibition."
p897
aS'The products that they can apply encompass all of those that post any risk to humans or the environment.'
p898
aS"It's true organic farmers request use natural products like copper fungicides, sulfur is used to help protect diseases."
p899
aS"Natural insecticide, Bacilus thuringiensis that Blake talked about, it's how Monsanto and other biotech companies have found a way to move the capacity to produce this natural insecticide into the corn plants."
p900
aS'And so without a doubt the reduction in exposure and risk from pesticides is the most common claim that you read.'
p901
aS'And there is no question that organic farming reduces pesticide risk.'
p902
aS"It's laughable for anybody to argue that it doesn't."
p903
aS'You know, American agriculture, apply rounds, a billion pounds of pesticides a year.'
p904
aS'Some are not terribly hazardous, including Glyfosate which Blake will use on some of his genetically engineered crops.'
p905
aS'But there are several other pesticides, especially insecticides to do pose significant risk.'
p906
aS"And the fact that we're all exposed to pesticides, even before we're born, does play a role in our public health."
p907
aS'Do you all know that the average baby born in America has like 200 chemicals in its blood the moment its born from the exposures to its mother?'
p908
aS'About one out of eight babies are born with a diagnosable birth defect?'
p909
aS'About a quarter of the couples in America are having trouble having babies.'
p910
aS'They need some help in getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to term.'
p911
aS'The scientific literature is loaded with thousands of papers that demonstrate a connection between exposure to pesticides and these adverse health outcomes.'
p912
aS"To say that there are no risks for pesticides and no evidence, I mean if you don't -- if you don't believe in science, fine."
