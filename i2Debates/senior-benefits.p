p36
aS"Tonight I'm going to do something a little different and share with you the reasons we thought that framing a debate on entitlements in intergenerational terms could shed some new light on a familiar topic."
p37
aS'American politics has focused endlessly, if inconclusively on health care, on the uninsured, on jobs, on entitlements and on the deficit.'
p38
aS'Fault lines have been drawn between liberals and conservatives, between rich and poor.'
p39
aS'But the intergenerational aspects of these issues have barely figured in the debate.'
p40
aS'One shocking statistic is that 37 percent of those who came of age in this millennium are unemployed.'
p41
aS'When consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and to higher, it is the young that suffer most.'
p42
aS'The health insurance debate focused on the uninsured.'
p43
aS'But think for a moment about how health insurance is priced.'
p44
aS'Almost everywhere the young pay the same premium as their more illness prone elders.'
p45
aS'A massive subsidy for the old paid for by the young.'
p46
aS'Tens of millions of young people quite reasonably said no thanks to health insurance until the government mandated that they say yes.'
p47
aS"Medicare and Social Security, Granny's benefits are some 35 percent of the federal government -- federal government budget and are projected to increase to 40 percent in the next decade as the baby boomers retire."
p48
aS'Health care costs are running around 16 percent of GNP compared to nine percent in other developed countries.'
p49
aS'And we have no better health outcomes to show for it.'
p50
aS'End of life care, the heroic measures taken in the final three months before a predictable end are around 25 percent of total health expenditures.'
p51
aS"We simply don't have the money to afford the health care system we've got."
p52
aS"When households want to consume something today that it can't pay for or doesn't choose to pay for, it can borrow money and pay it back with interest in the future, or it can borrow money and stiff its creditors through default, repaying debt with pennies on the dollar."
p53
aS"It's no different for governments."
p54
aS"If they won't cut spending, and they won't raise taxes, they can incur debt which the young will pay for with higher taxes later, or they can stiff their creditors through inflation, repaying the debt with devalued currency."
p55
aS"Young people are paying the costs of sluggish growth today, and they'll be paying the costs of profligate government tomorrow."
p56
aS'And neither political party has anything constructive to say.'
p57
aS"The Democrats don't want to cut entitlements, and the Republicans don't want to raise taxes to pay for them."
p58
aS"Perhaps that's why young people vote less than their elders."
p59
aS"Tonight they can make up for that lapse by voting twice, before the debate and after, after they've heard tonight's stellar panelists address the little noticed issues of America's intergenerational divide."

S"Well, as you've just heard, America's in very difficult shape."
p203
aS'And the difficult truth that we must face is that we are on the verge of an exploding public sector debt that can have a very, very negative effect on our economic future.'
p204
aS"As one cynic put it, our future isn't what it used to be."
p205
aS'Social Security was born amid harsh times of the Great Depression, marked by unemployment, homelessness and even starvation.'
p206
aS'We then made a deal with the American workers, to wit, that nobody who paid into the system would be left empty handed.'
p207
aS'To this was added Medicare, health insurance in the mid 1960s and the protection against inflation in the 1970s.'
p208
aS'These initiatives changed the economics of old age.'
p209
aS'In a mere four decades, poverty rates among the elderly, which had been three or four times that of the general population, fell below the rates for younger Americans.'
p210
aS'To this day, social security still means the difference between poverty and economic security for millions of retirees, children and many American workers.'
p211
aS'It is the primary source of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the single most important antipoverty program for children, millions of whom live in households supported by disability, survivor or retiree beneficiaries.'
p212
aS'It creates intergenerational benefits as parents and grandparents can live independently of their working children and often become the childcare providers for children while the parents work.'
p213
aS'When Social Security began making monthly distributions in 1940, there were 160 workers for every senior receiving benefits.'
p214
aS'Today, there are about three workers.'
p215
aS'And within two decades, there will be two.'
p216
aS'Demographic are destiny.'
p217
aS'The message could not be clearer.'
p218
aS'Social Security needs fixing.'
p219
aS'It has been fixed before.'
p220
aS'Social Security taxes have been raised 40 times since the program began, most recently in 1983.'
p221
aS'The initial Social Security tax was two percent, split between the employer and the employee, capped at $3,000 of earnings, which made for a maximum tax of $60.'
p222
aS'Today the tax is approximately 13 percent, capped at $106,800 for a maximum of tax of $13,234, a multiple of 80 times the original tax.'
p223
aS'So what is to be done?'
p224
aS'Despite the natural sympathy for those looking forward to their retirement, we cannot avoid the issue of Social Security insolvency.'
p225
aS'Here are some options to deal with this problem, one, gradually raising the retirement age to reflect the longevity increases that have already taken place.'
p226
aS'In the future, retirement age should be indexed automatically to rise with longevity.'
p227
aS'Two, raising employer and employee payroll taxes by up to one percent each.'
p228
aS'Three, eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income, reflecting the fact that higher incomes are rising faster than the Social Security taxable earnings.'
p229
aS"Four, increasing the earliest eligible age, EEA, as it's called, from 62 to 65, which alone would extend the trust fund solvency by about five years."
p230
aS'Current retirees would be unaffected.'
p231
aS'And exceptions would be made for Americans who cannot work longer due to injury, ill health, or other causes.'
p232
aS'Modest reductions in benefits for wealthier recipients should also be considered.'
p233
aS'We must address these challenges soon or Grandma\'s welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren and give meaning to the phrase which my partner and I have found out, we\'ll both, quote, "Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.'
p234
aS'" I might add -- -- that was originally stated by my partner\'s grandfather.'
p235
aS"The greatest risk facing America's fiscal future comes from the projected increases in Medicaid and Medicare spending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades."
p236
aS'Arithmetic still matters.'
p237
aS'Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans.'
p238
aS'It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes.'
p239
aS'The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state.'
p240
aS'Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending.'
p241
aS'Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade.'
p242
aS'In the next -- by the mid-1930s -- 2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.'
p243
aS'The basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on January 1 of this year, but there are 79 million more of them.'
p244
aS"Multiply that by estimated annual benefits of $40,000 that they will be receiving, and you're looking at $3 trillion a year just for that portion of the population."
p245
aS'Erskine Bowles, the co-chair of the bipartisan Simpson- Bowles Commission, put it well, "This is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable and from which there is no escape.'
p246
aS'This concern has been shared by many, many institutions, the Post, the Washington Post, the Fed chairman, Bernanke, and countless others.'
p247
aS'Now, the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs.'
p248
aS'The current programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases or huge cuts in other government programs.'
p249
aS'We should remember as we address this problem that less is enough if it comes earlier, so the sooner the better.'
p250
aS'Now, this is a nation founded on opportunity, not entitlement, on thrift, not conspicuous consumption, on stewardship and not living for today, but taking steps to make sure that we are creating a better tomorrow, such that future generations would have as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living.'
p251
aS'To keep these entitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the American dream alive.'
p252
aS"I know the American dream because I'm one of the people who was attracted to this country many years ago from Canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of American universities moved to the United States, attracted as we were by the remarkable energy and optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country, not to mention the president, John Kennedy."
p253
aS"Today it is Canada's government that has shown best how to manage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economic times without threatening its future."
p254
aS"But much as I like Canada, I don't want my children moving there because of the narrowing of opportunity at home."

p286
aS'In the future, retirement ageshould be indexed automatically to rise with longevity.'
p287
aS'Two, raising employer andemployee payroll taxes by up to one percent each.Three, eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income, reflecting thefact that higher incomes are rising faster than the Social Security taxable earnings.'
p288

aS'We must address these challenges soon orGrandma\'s welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren andgive meaning to the phrase which my partner and I have found out, we\'ll both, quote,"Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.'

aS'" I might add ---- that was originally stated by my partner\'s grandfather.'
p294
aS"The greatest risk facing [[laughter]] America's fiscal future comes from the projected increases in Medicaid and Medicarespending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades.Arithmetic still matters."
p295
aS'Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care forroughly 55 million Americans.'
p296
aS'It finances more than one third of all births in the UnitedStates, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes.'
p297
aS'Thefederal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the incomelevel of each state.'
p298
aS'Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growingcategory of state spending.'
p299
aS'Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years andare expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eightpercent annually for the next decade.'
p300
aS'In the next -- by the mid-1930s -- 2030s, the 65and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising farfaster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out ofcontrol, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.The basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on January 1 of this year,but there are 79 million more of them.'
p301
aS"Multiply that by estimated annual benefits of$40,000 that they will be receiving, and you're looking at $3 trillion a year just for thatportion of the population."
p302
aS'Erskine Bowles, the co-chair of the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, put it well, "This is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable andfrom which there is no escape.'
p303
aS'This concern has been shared by many, manyinstitutions, the Post, the Washington Post, the Fed chairman, Bernanke, and countlessothers.'
p304
aS'Now, the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs.'
p305
aS'Thecurrent programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases orhuge cuts in other government programs.'
p306
aS'We should remember as we address thisproblem that less is enough if it comes earlier, so the sooner the better.Now, this is a nation founded on opportunity, not entitlement, on thrift, notconspicuous consumption, on stewardship and not living for today, but taking steps tomake sure that we are creating a better tomorrow, such that future generations wouldhave as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living.'
p307
aS'To keep theseentitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the American dream alive.'
p308
aS"I know theAmerican dream because I'm one of the people who was attracted to this country manyyears ago from Canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of Americanuniversities moved to the United States, attracted as we were by the remarkable energyand optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country, not to mention thepresident, John Kennedy."
p309
aS"Today it is Canada's government that has shown best how tomanage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economictimes without threatening its future.But much as I like Canada, I don't want my children moving there because of thenarrowing of opportunity at home."

p608

p618

aS"I would be remiss also if I didn't mention what we all know, which is that large parts of the federal budget are being financed by debt, 42 cents on every dollar."
p620
aS'And this debt, too, must be paid back.'
p621
aS'By 2021, interest payments on the debt will be a bigger portion of the budget than our discretionary funding, which will contribute to a crowding out of spending in education, infrastructure, national defense and everything else that might be considered investment in our future.'

aS'We can have a generous, compassionate social welfare program for the elderly which is consistent with a dynamic economy in which workers have multiple employers over their careers, stay active and healthy in the work force into their 70s.'

p634
aS'This is not true.'

p636
aS'They may argue as well that entitlements, the benefits about which we are debating tonight, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are not the problem at all, that the real problem for Junior is skyrocketing health care costs.'

p638
aS"Health care reforms are an important subject, just not the subject of tonight's debate."
p639

p729
aS"She also did something else that is -- that you all have been victimized by for some time and that is frame the debate in such a way that we're focused on giving people big tax cuts at the same time we're focused on cutting benefits."
p730
aS'The truth is that we do not have a Medicare and Social Security problem in terms of what it is costing us.'
p731
aS"What we have is bad management, politicians who won't talk to each other and work with each other, lousy tax policy, selfishness as a public policy, and growing inequality in America."
p732
aS'This is not an issue about taxes.'
p733
aS'So a few facts, Social Security is in fact a trust fund.'
p734
aS'There are $2.6 trillion in the tax fund.'
p735
aS'They are invested in treasuries in the Social Security fund.'
p736
aS'By 2020 there will be $3.5 trillion in the Social Security trust fund set aside, put aside by you for spending by you.'
p737
aS'Is there a shortfall in Social Security?'
p738
aS'Yes.'
p739
aS'Is that the single biggest problem of our deficit?'
p740
aS'No.'
p741
aS'You know the single largest factor in our national debt is?'
p742
aS'This is the CBO, this is not some leftwing democratic think tank like MSNBC.'
p743
aS'Sixty percent of the deficit in 2019 is due solely to the Bush tax cuts, 60 percent.'
p744
aS"Now, that's a fact, I'm not -- if you don't want to raise taxes, be my guest, but if this is a debate between raising taxes and dealing with Social Security, you should know that because these neither of these problems is the big problem, the problem is not Social Security."
p745
aS'I agree with Mort, there are a lot of things you can do about this.'
p746
aS'Margaret mentioned some good things you can do about Social Security.'
p747
aS"We have to tweak Social Security, yes, it's not a big problem."
p748
aS'Medicare, Medicare is not the problem.'
p749
aS'Its costs are out of control.'
p750
aS"There's a reason for that."
p751
aS'The costs of the entire health care system in the United States of America are out of control.'
p752
aS"There's no way you're going to control Medicare costs without doing something about the rest of the health care costs, and that means we have to have real health care reform, which we have not had."
p753
aS'And the real health care reform has not taken place either under Romney Care/Obama Care or whatever the Republicans want to call it these days, it has not taken place because the entire reimbursement system of the health care, Medicare, or private sector, encourages me to do as much as I can to you whether it works or not, and the more I do, the more I get paid.'
p754
aS'We need to fundamentally get rid of the fee for service system, capitated care, some of the things in the health care bill such as accountable care organizations, vertically integrated care, will solve the Medicare problem, period.'
p755
aS'We do not need to privatize either one of those programs.'
p756
aS"And for those of you on Social Security, could you imagine if President Bush had has his way and we'd privatized Social Security shortly before 2008, I don't think many of you would have been able to afford the $40 ticket that you paid to get in here."
p757
aS'So let us not allow the right wing to focus on these two programs or the idea that we ought to reform them.'
p758
aS"Let's reform our tax system so we have a more equal more fair society and then we can talk about how to deal with these systems."
p759
aS'Now, what can, in fact, we do?'
p760
aS'We talked a little bit about how to fix Medicare.'
p761
aS'We do need to start paying people in a global budget, pay the hospitals and the doctors a flat fee for taking care of people.'
p762
aS'Then, all of a sudden, guess what?'
p763
aS'Prevention will pay.'
p764
aS'Nobody invests in prevention today except for Kaiser or self-insured major corporations.'
p765
aS'We can change all of that.'
p766
aS'There need to be some reforms, but we do not need to make this a private system, and we do not need to withdraw government support from this system.'
p767
aS'We dont even need to reduce benefits.'
p768
aS'We do need to change the way we pay for health care, not just to save Medicare and older people.'
p769
aS'We need to save business by doing this.'
p770
aS'We need to save individuals by doing this.'
p771
aS'We fundamentally have to reform health care.'
p772
aS'Lets not use Medicare and Social Security as the victim.'
p773
aS'The fact of the matter is that young people inevitably are going to end up as my age.'
p774
aS'And when they do, theyre not going to want these programs to disappear.'
p775
aS'The elderly used to be the poorest group in American until in 1926 the farm states where the Depression started began Social Security, which has then spread to a national program by Roosevelt in 1933.'
p776
aS'So this is a core program.'
p777
aS'We just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks.'
p778
aS'Health care needs a lot of tweaks, but the whole system needs tweaks, not simply Medicare.'
p779
aS'And we should stop victimizing Medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low.'
p780
aS'The fact is people need to pay their fair share in America, and the Bush tax cuts need to sunset.'
p781
aS'You know, when the taxes were at Bill Clintons rate, the economy was a whole lot better than it is now.'
p782
aS'And I wouldnt mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all.'
p783
aS'In conclusion, the solution to this problem is not to return the elderly to poverty.'
p784
aS'The elderly programs do not harm young people in this country, because if we did not have them, you would be living with them so you could take care of them at the same time as you tried to make your own lives.'
p785
aS'These programs were put in for a reason.'
p786
aS'It is a social compact.'
p787
aS'And Ill close with the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes.'
p788
aS'Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.'
p789
aS'And for those who continue to want to avoid them more and more, seeking tax cuts when we already have enormous deficits, you will end up paying the price, because -- and I say this not as somebody whos a liberal or on the left.'
p790
aS'I say this as a social observer.'
p791
aS'There is no society on the face of the earth now or in the past which has not collapsed when the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in that society has become too big.'
p792
aS'We are going down a very dangerous road.'
