p197
aS'One is the need tocompete in a global economy, an economy that has changed hugely even as many of ushave been wrestling with it.'
p198
aS'Number two, we have the effects of the global recession:state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now.'
p199
aS"And so whenthe investment is very, very bleak, as it is right now, and the need is very, very great, it'sno wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame."
p200
aS'But my friends, blamingunions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession.'
p201
aS'Ultimatelywhat humans do -- what our union does proudly is have a mantra.'
p202
aS'What is good for kidsand what is fair for teachers.'
p203
aS"Now, am I saying that everything we've ever done is the3right thing?"
p204
aS'Absolutely not.'
p205
aS'Am I saying that we are perfect?'
p206
aS'Absolutely not.'
p207
aS'But whatwe are trying to do in this very, very turbulent time is search for what works.'
p208
aS'Search forwhat works for kids.'
p209
aS'Let me ask -- let me suggest this.'
p210
aS'If teachers unions were to beblamed for failing schools, then we would assume that schools in less unionized stateswould outperform schools in more densely unionized states.'
p211
aS"So you'd assume that placeslike Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, who have relatively few unionized teachers woulddo much, much better."
p212
aS"But that's not the case."
p213
aS'The states with the most denselyunionized teachers, Massachusetts, New York, Maryland; they do the best.'
p214
aS'And thecountries with the most densely unionized populations: Finland, Japan, they do the best.So what do we learn from that?'
p215
aS'What we know is that there are problems like Mr.Rosenkranz said.'
p216
aS'There are problems we have to solve.'
p217
aS'One of which is poverty.'
p218
aS'Stateslike Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi; they have and had been plagued by tremendouspoverty.'
p219
aS'We have to compete with poverty.'
p220
aS"That's what public education is and that iswhat the search we have for, that's what our search is, to find what works."
p221
aS'So you felt, Ihope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions, to problem solving.'
p222
aS"And Iwould argue to all of you that having a strong union, someone in an entity that will lookat what it's done right and what it's done wrong, and solve things and change things, is theway to go."
p223
aS'So what works?'
p224
aS'What can we learn from places like Maryland,Massachusetts, New York State, Finland, and Japan?'
p225
aS'This is what we can learn.'
p226
aS'This iswhat works.'
p227
aS"What works in places where we don't as Terry Moe will probably argue,where we don't have niche markets, where we can't marketize our schools, where wehave to help all kids."
p228
aS'So we need well-prepared and supported teachers.'
p229
aS'We need well-rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around.'
p230
aS'We needto invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction.'
p231
aS'We also need things likeearly childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school.And finally, we need good services to help level the playing field for kids.'
p232
aS'Now, is this apanacea?'
p233
aS"Is this something that has never happened and it's a search for something wedon't know how to find?"
p234
aS'No.'
p235
aS'We find these elements in lots of different places.'
p236
aS"And theglue that binds us together, the difference between the places that work and the placesthat don't are good labor management relationships."
p237
aS'Like we see in one of my otherpanelists here, in the ABC school district in California which has lifted its scores, whichhas changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative.'
p238
aS"Does thatmean as I said before that we've done everything."
p239
aS'Of course not.'
p240
aS'Everyone has to takemore responsibility in this day and age.'
p241
aS"If we're going to ensure that all kids are ready forlife, for college, for career, that means that -- that means we all have to take collectiveresponsibility."
p242
aS'And we, at the A.F.T., attempted to do that in any number of ways: first,in pushing for common standards, including the new common core curriculum or thecommon core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments, in pushing for bettercurriculum.'
p243
aS'And in looking at ourselves and saying look, we have to have a newapproach to due process.'
p244
aS"We can't have rubber rooms anymore."
p245
aS"We can't have a choicebetween off with your heads and warehousing."
p246
aS"We can't have situations where if there isincompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen."
p247
aS'We have to have moreevaluation systems that are fair, that are meaningful, that are competent, and that actuallyhelp teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now.'
p248
aS'But we also haveto give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good jobwith kids.'
p249
aS'Because at the end of the day, to compete with poverty, to drift all boats, to4make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it, it comes withinitially that connection between teacher and kid.'
p250
aS'That connection we made every daythat we teach.'

p361
aS'So look.'
p362
aS'Let me start with an obvious example.'
p363
aS'Theteachers unions have fought for all sorts of protections in labor contracts and in state lawsthat make it virtually impossible to get bad teachers out of the classroom.'
p364
aS"On average, ittakes two years, $200,000, and 15% of the principal's total time to get one bad teacher outof the classroom."
p365
aS"As a result, principals don't even try."
p366
aS'They give 99% of teachers -- nojoke -- satisfactory evaluations.'
p367
aS'The bad teachers just stay in the classroom.'
p368
aS"Well, if wefigure that maybe 5% of the teachers, that's a conservative estimate, are bad teachersnationwide, that means that 2.5 million kids are stuck in classrooms with teachers whoaren't teaching them anything."
p369
aS'This is devastating.'
p370
aS'And the unions are largely5responsible for that.'
p371
aS"They're also responsible for seniority provisions in these laborcontracts that among other things often allow senior teachers to stake a claim to desirablejobs, even if they're not good teachers and even if they're a bad fit for that school."
p372
aS'Theseniority rules often require districts to lay off junior people before senior people.'
p373
aS"It'shappening all around the country now."
p374
aS'And some of these junior people are some of thebest teachers in the district.'
p375
aS'And some of the senior people that are being saved are theworst.'
p376
aS'Okay.'
p377
aS"So just ask yourself, would anyone in his right mind organize schools inthis way, if all they cared about was what's best for kids?"

p383
aS"And the whole time the teachers' unions have used their extraordinary power inthe political process to try to block reform and make sure that real reform just neverhappens."
p384

aS'If you give kids choice and they can leave regular public schools, then they takemoney and they take jobs with them.'
p390
aS"And that's what the teachers' unions want to stop.So what they've done is they've used their power in the political process to put a ceilingon the numbers of charter schools."

aS'As a result in this country today, we have 4,600charter schools.'
p392
aS'There are like well over 90,000 public schools.'
p393

p562

p563
aS'Ourstudents perform higher than anybody else in this country academically.'
p564
aS'Yet we have thestrongest collective bargaining rights in the country.'
p565
aS"So do me it just doesn't add up.And then I started thinking I'm also a doctoral student so I'm trying to learn as much as Ican about research and so the next thing I did is I went straight to the literature."
p566
aS'EvenProfessor Moe said publications are all saying the same thing.'
p567
aS'There is no research tosupport what he is saying.'
p568
aS'There is no research out there that correlates studentachievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism, either for or against.7There is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want.'
p569
aS'And publicize.'
p570
aS"Itdoesn't mean that it's research-based."
p571
aS'So with that, what do collective bargaining rates doto improve schools?'
p572
aS'And I have a lot to say.'
p573
aS"Not only am I a teacher, I'm the executivevice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell, and I deal with this firsthand as a unionleader."
p574
aS'And for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to providedignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot.'
p575
aS'And the way that we can dothat is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also forchildren.'
p576
aS'So one example of that, which unfortunately in my district -- my union has notbeen able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes.'
p577
aS"Soearly childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is goodfor them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract."
p578
aS"That'sjust one example."
p579
aS'The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a locallevel is it ensures academic freedom.'
p580
aS'What that means is there are times as a teacher thatI need to advocate for the child.'
p581
aS'And that means I have to say something unpopular,something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and Ineed to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that I can be.'
p582
aS'And I need to be able to dothat without fear.'
p583
aS"And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important whenyou are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children.And that is why it's important."
p584
aS'Besides families, no one cares more about students andtheir learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers.'
p585
aS"And what theteachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers."
p586
aS'So whilemy opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda, I would argue that isabsolutely not true.'
p587
aS'My agenda is the agenda of the teachers.'
p588
aS'What the teachers need.So the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and thesuperintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools andmeet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done.'
p589
aS'We survey ourmembers.'
p590
aS'And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda.'
p591
aS"So for example onething that we've done is we've created what's been called -- the Department of Educationin Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program."
p592
aS"So the unionand management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure thatevery teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor.They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so thatthey can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues,they have full training in what they need."
p593
aS"Also with that, the mentors are trained to talkto their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not."
p594
aS"And to counsel themperhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting thechildren's need."
p595
aS'And also, to help them make better choices.'
p596
aS'Another thing that wasunion initiated that is in our contract, we call the Lowell program.'
p597
aS"It's an in-housegraduate program where teachers can get their master's degree."
p598
aS'Again, the superintendentand her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work togetherso that teachers are given the tools that they need.'
p599
aS"In terms of evaluations, our evaluationprocedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required bystate standard."
p600
aS'So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the stateonly mandates once.'
p601
aS"So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it'sjust not true."
p602
aS"The most important thing in my opinion about what we've done -- and Ican't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, I was only in high school, but I can8speak to what's happening in schools now."
p603
aS'And what we are doing is this labormanagement union.'
p604
aS'Because with all due respect, we have been -- the teachers have beentold what to do.'
p605
aS"We've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants andunder these grants, and we found -- the teachers found they were not working forchildren."
p606
aS"19:09:52 We've told what to do."
p607
aS'Now what we need to do is have a seat at thetable to be part of the decision making.'
p608
aS'And so in Lowell we have begun this journey tobuild collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the peopleat the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children.'

p631
aS'So with that, what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools?'
p632
aS'And I have a lot to say.'
p633
aS"Not only am I a teacher, I'm the executive vice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell, and I deal with this firsthand as a union leader."
p634
aS'And for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot.'
p635
aS'And the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also for children.'
p636
aS'So one example of that, which unfortunately in my district -- my union has not been able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes.'
p637
aS"So early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract."
p638
aS"That's just one example."
p639
aS'The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom.'
p640
aS'What that means is there are times as a teacher that I need to advocate for the child.'
p641
aS'And that means I have to say something unpopular, something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and I need to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that I can be.'
p642
aS'And I need to be able to do that without fear.'
p643
aS'And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children.'
p644
aS"And that is why it's important."
p645
aS'Besides families, no one cares more about students and their learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers.'
p646
aS"And what the teachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers."
p647
aS'So while my opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda, I would argue that is absolutely not true.'
p648
aS'My agenda is the agenda of the teachers.'
p649
aS'What the teachers need.'
p650
aS'So the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and the superintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done.'
p651
aS'We survey our members.'
p652
aS'And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda.'
p653
aS"So for example one thing that we've done is we've created what's been called -- the Department of Education in Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program."
p654
aS"So the union and management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor."
p655
aS'They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues, they have full training in what they need.'
p656
aS"Also with that, the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not."
p657
aS"And to counsel them perhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting the children's need."
p658
aS'And also, to help them make better choices.'
p659
aS'Another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract, we call the Lowell program.'
p660
aS"It's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master's degree."
p661
aS'Again, the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need.'
p662
aS"In terms of evaluations, our evaluation procedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required by state standard."
p663
aS'So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the state only mandates once.'
p664
aS"So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it's just not true."
p665
aS"The most important thing in my opinion about what we've done -- and I can't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, I was only in high school, but I can 8 speak to what's happening in schools now."
p666
aS'And what we are doing is this labor management union.'
p667
aS'Because with all due respect, we have been -- the teachers have been told what to do.'
p668
aS"We've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants, and we found -- the teachers found they were not working for children."
p669
aS"19:09:52 We've told what to do."
p670
aS'Now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making.'
p671
aS'And so in Lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children.'
p672
aS'So it is, indeed, what is best for them.'
