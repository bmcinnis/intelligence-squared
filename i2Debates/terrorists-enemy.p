aS'As we assemble tonight a few days after the anniversary of 9/11, it shouldbe obvious that there are distinctions between terrorists and criminals as well as betweenterrorists and soldiers, just as there are distinctions between counter-terrorism and thecriminal justice system and the laws of war.'
p31
aS'A major function of criminal law is to detercrime.'
p32
aS'The reason we allow an insanity defense in criminal cases is because the insanecannot be deterred.'
p33
aS'Obviously suicide bombers cannot be deterred either.'
p34
aS'Anotherfunction of criminal law is punishment: interrogations are conducted to link suspects withcrimes that have already been committed so we can punish the guilty.When we interrogate suspected terrorists, the goal is to prevent attacks before they occur.In criminal proceedings, we would prefer to see a guilty man go free than to compromiseour sense of fairness.'
p35
aS'That is why, for example, the most damning evidence of guiltcannot be used if it is obtained illegally.'
p36
aS'Turning to the laws of war, the GenevaConvention is in part a bill of rights for soldiers in uniform; but the convention equallyprotects civilians by making them readily distinguishable from soldiers.Tonights resolution is about whether these distinctions should or should not make adifference.'
p37
aS'Are the substance and procedures of standard criminal practice consistentwith our societal needs for intelligence and security?'
p38
aS'Do the Geneva Conventionprotections for soldiers in uniform apply to non-state actors, who are not parties to theconvention and who blend with and deliberately target civilian populations?'
p39
aS'Finally, ifwe dont treat terrorists like criminals, and we dont treat them like soldiers, where do welook for constraints on our military, intelligence officers, and interrogators so that theiractions are consistent with our societal values?These are vexing issues, and we have an outstanding panel with us this evening to discussthem.'

aS'Andthe questions we were all asking.'
p164
aS'Who had attacked us?'
p165
aS'What do they want?'
p166
aS'Were theremore attacks coming?'
p167
aS'If I had told you back then that we would go almost a decadewithout another terrorist attack, who would have believed me?Very few, I think, a few.'
p168
aS'Most of thought it was going to be the first of many attacks.'
p169
aS'Iwas in the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001.'
p170
aS'I was blessed not to be not at the point ofimpact, but I was a few corridors down and I remember feeling the building shudder; Iremember the smell of the smoke in the hallways.'
p171
aS'And the one thing I remember verydistinctly is that the alarms never went off, the evacuation alarms.'
p172
aS'We all just sort offiled out of the building and went on out to the lawn and looked back at the broken andburning Pentagon.But in the months that followed, the alarms went off a bunch of times as false reports ofimpending attacks, planes that were headed our way kept coming in.'
p173
aS'And every time, thewhole building, we would all evacuate and go out on the lawn and look up at the sky,waiting for the attack that never came.'
p174
aS'Why did that attack never come?'
p175
aS'I would submitto you there are only two possibilities.'
p176
aS'Either the terrorists lost interest in attacking usagain, or we found out what their plans were and stopped them from carrying them out.'
p177
aS'Mike Hayden and I will argue tonight that the latter is the case.'
p178
aS'We will argue that thereason that attack did not happen is because we abandoned the law enforcement approachto terrorism that failed to stop the 1992 World Trade Center bombing, that failed to stopthe attack on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that failed to stop the attack on theUSS Cole, that failed to stop the attacks of 9/11.'
p179
aS'That we abandoned that approach andbegan to treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals.In those early days after 9/11, we knew almost nothing about the enemy who hadattacked us.'
p180
aS'We did not know that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of9/11; he wasnt even on our charts.'
p181
aS'And we didnt know who his accomplices were.'
p182
aS'And unbeknownst to us, there were two terrorist networks out there, at large, planningnew attacks.'
p183
aS'The KSM network that had planned and carried out 9/11, and the Hambalinetwork which was a Southeast Asian terrorist that KSM had organized because he knewwed be on the lookout for Arab men.And those terror networks were in the advanced stages of planning a series of attacksincluding a plot to blow up high-rise apartment buildings in the United States usingnatural gas, a plot to repeat 9/11 in Europe by flying airplanes into Heathrow Airport indowntown London, a plot to blow up the U.S. consulate in Karachi and westernresidences in Karachi, an al-Qaeda cell that was developing anthrax for attacks inside theUnited States and a cell, the Garaba cell, the southeast Asians whoKSM had tasked to fly an airplane into the tallest building in the west coast, the LibraryTower in Los Angeles.'
p184
aS'We did not know any of this, not a word.'
p185
aS'We didnt know whothose people were, what they had planned.'
p186
aS'And then we started capturing terrorists.'
p187
aS'AbuZubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh, KSM, and they provided us information that allowed us toround up and dismantle both of those terror networks.When KSM was captured and brought into custody, he was asked about upcomingattacks.'
p188
aS'You know what he said?'
p189
aS'Ill tell you everything when I get to New York andsee my lawyer.'
p190
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, our opponents tonight would have granted thatrequest.'
p191
aS'And if we had listened to their advice, if we had told KSM you have the right toremain silent, there would be craters in the ground in Los Angeles and Karachi andLondon and other cities in this country because of the attack that we did not stop.'
p192
aS'Thisdebate is about more than Miranda rights.'
p193
aS'The Obama administration had eliminated theCIA program, but at least theyre killing terrorists using predator drones, right?'
p194
aS'No, no,no say our opponents, thats illegal too.'
p195
aS'The ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rightsfiled a lawsuit a couple weeks ago saying that because terrorists outside of Iraq andAfghanistan are criminals and not enemy combatants, we cannot kill terrorists in thoseareas using predator drones.'
p196
aS'So if you believe that we should not kill terrorists usingpredator drones, then vote for them.The fact is that that program has killed half the al-Qaeda leadership and it is probably theonly thing standing between us and another 9/11.One final point, our opponents are going to try to turn this into a debate onwaterboarding.'
p197
aS'Im happy to have that debate.'
p198
aS'As John pointed out, I wrote a bookdefending it.'
p199
aS'But if theyre arguing about waterboarding, theyre losing and Ill tell youwhy.'
p200
aS'It is a little known fact -- how many people think Barack Obama endedwaterboarding?'
p201
aS'He didnt.'
p202
aS'My debate partner Mike Hayden ended waterboarding.'
p203
aS'When Mike Hayden handed over the CIA program to Barack Obama, the techniquesinvolved were the tummy slap, the facial hold, mild sleep deprivation and a diet of liquidEnsure.'
p204
aS'Im sure the makers of liquid Ensure will be thrilled to know that their product istorture.Bottom line is, there is a wide area between waterboarding on one hand and telling KSM [[Laugher]] and other terrorists, you have the right to remain silent.'
p205
aS'So you can be againstwaterboarding and for the proposition, that we should treat terrorists as criminals, as --before the proposition, we should treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals.'
p206
aS'So finally Id just like to ask you, keep in mind, if you would like to keep killingterrorists with predator drones, if you would like -- if you think that our first priority inthe war on terror, when we capture a terrorist should be interrogating them forintelligence, not obtaining evidence for prosecution; if you want to continue the approachto counterterrorism that has prevented us from being struck again as we were on 9/11,then I ask you to vote for our position.'

p321

p322
aS'weve seen it over and overagain where the police or the FBI or New York, NYPD breaks up a terrorist cell or justdiscovers a plot in progress or conspiracy, and those people can be arrested.They can be interrogated by law enforcement, and in those interrogations yield a lot ofinformation.'

aS'I decided to talk our European friends about rendition, detention and interrogation.'
p559
aS'I had a wonderful speechwriting staff at CIA, but this was a speech that I took a personal hand at.'
p560
aS'On page two of that speech, I simply said to our European friends, let me tell you what I believe, what my agency believes, what I believe my country believes.'
p561
aS'We are a nation at war.'
p562
aS'We are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.'
p563
aS'This war is global in scope and I can only fulfill my legal and moral responsibilities to the citizens of my republic by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be.'
p564
aS'A year ago last August, August of 2009 I was in Phoenix.'
p565
aS'President Obama was addressing the VFW.'
p566
aS'He said quite clearly we are at war; we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.'
p567
aS'Now I know most of the American population doesnt sense they are at war.'
p568
aS'I know that.'
p569
aS'The American Armed Forces know that we are.'
p570
aS'The American security establishment knows that we are.'
p571
aS'The American intelligence community knows that we are.'
p572
aS'You, your political processes have sent me, a career military officer, the director the CIA to war.'
p573
aS'You have told me to defend you.'
p574
aS'Do not take away from me the tools that I need to perform the service you demand.'
p575
aS'At some point in our conversation tonight, there will be a discussion here about we need to uphold the rule of law.'
p576
aS'I could not agree more.'
p577
aS'It just matters what model of law we are committed to upholding.'
p578
aS'Is this an issue best addressed through American criminal law or is this an issue best addressed through the laws of armed conflict?'
p579
aS'I submit to you that its only the laws of armed conflict that will keep you safe.'
p580
aS'This isnt theoretical for me; this was real.'
p581
aS'I had a meeting with my general counsel and his team at CIA about two years ago.'
p582
aS'I said to the team, our enemy is opening a new front.'
p583
aS'They are beginning to attack us, with attack in quotes, its a bit metaphorical.'
p584
aS'They are beginning to attack us in the American legal system.'
p585
aS'We have to best them in the legal system the way we are defeating them in the tribal region of Pakistan.'
p586
aS'And I told my lawyers, I want you to lean as far forward and the hardest as you possibly can in terms of giving information to our court system.'
p587
aS'I want blood on the harness, you are leaning so far forward.'
p588
aS'We worked our tails off in those judicial processes, specifically habeas corpus.'
p589
aS'When we got a point where we could go no farther, one of the judges demanded that we provide not him, but the defendant, the name and the identity of the intelligence source we had used in order to determine that he was a member of al-Qaeda.'
p590
aS'I know you dont live in the world I used to live in, but there is nothing that a director of CIA could do in those circumstances.'
p591
aS'You cannot let the world know that sources who risk everything, who risk all to work for you, will have their names revealed in the American judicial process, to the individual they have identified as al-Qaeda.'
p592
aS'The Christmas attack is another little morality play.'
p593
aS'It really demonstrates the fallacy of treating this as a law enforcement matter.'
p594
aS'When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to down an American aircraft, he was a member of al-Qaeda; he was an enemy combatant.'
p595
aS'It was an attack mounted from outside the United States towards and in the United States.'
p596
aS'And because of a law enforcement mentality, we sent a clean team in there.'
p597
aS'A clean team; that is somebody in the FBI who knew nothing of what Abdulmutallab had told us.'
p598
aS'After only 50 minutes of interrogation, every known al- Qaeda aircraft attack this country has involved multiple threats of attack: 9/11, 2006 from London, the Bojinka plot over the Pacific.'
p599
aS'And yet after 50 minutes, our instincts were so strong to the law enforcement that we allowed him to lawyer up.'
p600
aS'Thats unconscionable.'
p601
aS'Thats a terrible decision.'
p602
aS'It is based upon a model that you know, hes just a criminal and we just need to make sure we get him in jail.'
