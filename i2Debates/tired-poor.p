p235
aS"I think tonight's a good placeto do it, its -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that wasdesigned to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration."
p236
aS'Indeed it had nothing to dowith immigration policy.'
p237
aS'It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic.In fact, the statue was called Liberty Enlightening the World.'
p238
aS'It was not calledLiberty Inviting the World.'
p239
aS'As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 yearsafter the statue got here.And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking aboutthe need to limit immigration to various groups.'
p240
aS'Remember also that a lot of the tired,and poor, and huddled masses got stamped return to sender" here at Ellis Island.'
p241
aS'Therewere people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, andif anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over atEllis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could getyou sent home.'
p242
aS'It was not a take all comers time in American history.'
p243
aS'As for the poor,well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringentregulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy.In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, "A visible estate ormanual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge tothe respective place that he shall come to inhabit.'
p244
aS'" In 1996 in the Congress of the UnitedStates, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavitsigned by someone if youre coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support.'
p245
aS'Theyput it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it beenenforced.'
p246
aS'And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degreeof poverty into the United States.'
p247
aS'The National Academy of Sciences along with theCenter for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, aresignificantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigranthouseholds.Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes werepaid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost toAmerican taxpayers of over $150 billion annually.'
p248
aS'Now, my point here is to show thatfor a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, andbelieve, is a rational policy.'
p249
aS'It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especiallyduring the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people whowere low-skill, low-wage people.'
p250
aS'Why?'
p251
aS'Because, of course, we were building theIndustrial Revolution here.'
p252
aS'They were fueling it.'
p253
aS'That was appropriate.'
p254
aS'It was right.'
p255
aS'Itserved purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here.'
p256
aS'I hope-- well, also, as I see were getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there isanother myth I want to try to dispel quickly.And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the timeAmerica started until today, that its always just been going up.'
p257
aS'Absolutely untrue.About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States.'
p258
aS'Itstarted to climb.'
p259
aS'By 1850, it started to go down.'
p260
aS'Around 1880, it grew.'
p261
aS'Around 1890, itdeclined.'
p262
aS'It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramaticallyafter the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924.'
p263
aS'It stayed relatively low for along period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with theImmigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator TeddyKennedy.'
p264
aS'And weve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workersever since that period of time.Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization Ijust gave you of immigration was purposeful or not.'
p265
aS'It had and served a good purpose, Ithink.'
p266
aS'We had periods of high immigration.'
p267
aS'We had periods of low immigration.'
p268
aS'Andyou know what happened during the periods of low immigration?'
p269
aS'People used that timeto assimilate.'
p270
aS'And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the mostimportant aspect of the debate.'
p271
aS'Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts ofimmigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially,as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it.Or, if it doesnt happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take abreak, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is notoccurring.Its not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you cant categorically say that, but it iscertainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country.'
p272
aS'We desperatelyneed, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, tothink about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart.'

aS"I think tonight's a good place to do it, its -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration."
p286
aS'Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy.'
p287
aS'It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic.'
p288
aS'In fact, the statue was called Liberty Enlightening the World.'
p289
aS'It was not called Liberty Inviting the World.'
p290
aS'As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here.'
p291
aS'And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups.'
p292
aS'Remember also that a lot of the tired, and poor, and huddled masses got stamped return to sender" here at Ellis Island.'
p293
aS'There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home.'
p294
aS'It was not a take all comers time in American history.'
p295
aS'As for the poor, well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy.'
p296
aS'In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, "A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit.'
p297
aS'" In 1996 in the Congress of the United States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if youre coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support.'
p298
aS'They put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced.'
p299
aS'And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States.'
p300
aS'The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households.'
p301
aS'Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually.'
p302
aS'Now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and believe, is a rational policy.'
p303
aS'It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especially during the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people.'
p304
aS'Why?'
p305
aS'Because, of course, we were building the Industrial Revolution here.'
p306
aS'They were fueling it.'
p307
aS'That was appropriate.'
p308
aS'It was right.'
p309
aS'It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here.'
p310
aS'I hope -- well, also, as I see were getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly.'
p311
aS'And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today, that its always just been going up.'
p312
aS'Absolutely untrue.'
p313
aS'About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States.'
p314
aS'It started to climb.'
p315
aS'By 1850, it started to go down.'
p316
aS'Around 1880, it grew.'
p317
aS'Around 1890, it declined.'
p318
aS'It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924.'
p319
aS'It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy Kennedy.'
p320
aS'And weve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time.'
p321
aS'Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not.'
p322
aS'It had and served a good purpose, I think.'
p323
aS'We had periods of high immigration.'
p324
aS'We had periods of low immigration.'
p325
aS'And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration?'
p326
aS'People used that time to assimilate.'
p327
aS'And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate.'
p328
aS'Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it.'
p329
aS'Or, if it doesnt happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring.'
p330
aS'Its not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you cant categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country.'
p331
aS'We desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart.'
p332
aS'And Im afraid our immigration policy is doing just that.'

p387
aS'And in the background of the coverage in one of theshots on ABC or CNN ---- one of the networks that was covering it, there was laid out on a fence post, the UnitedStates flag, the flag of America.'
p388
aS'And I was surprised to see that, although it was awelcome sight.'
p389
aS'But there was something in my mind that told me that that American flaglooked out of place at the Royal Wedding.'
p390
aS"And as I thought about it more, the reasonthat our American flag looked out of place is because our country has never been acountry about royalty or caste or one's station in life."
p391
aS'It has always been defined as acountry for the strivers, for the aspirers, for the folks who can pull themselves up by theirboot straps, who are willing to take the chance, the entrepreneurs, most of whom start offas folks of lesser means, folks who make themselves.And this country, the United States, of all the countries in the world and all the countriesthroughout history, has defined itself as the nation that has taken in folks from around theworld and allowed them to pursue their dreams, to reach their American dream and tobecome, from some who was poor and huddled among masses, to someone who issuccessful and able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalist system.'
p392
aS'And so it is that I believewe need to continue to welcome not only the wealthy but the poor from other countries.We need to do that for several reasons.'
p393
aS'The first is that immigrants are vital to ournational economy.'
p394
aS'Immigrants actually found companies at almost twice the rate ofnative born U.S. citizens.'
p395
aS'Companies founded by immigrants in the years between 1995and 2005 actually created 450,000 jobs in the United States of America.In one single year, they generated $52 billion in sales in industries like high technologyand engineering; that the number of folks who start those companies is at 25 percentnationally.'
p396
aS"And in Silicon Valley, it's at 52.4 percent."
p397
aS"And remember, it is a falsedistinction to think that the folks who found these companies start off as wealthy.Oftentimes they don't."
p398
aS'Think about your own experience, either in your own family, orhow many times have you heard someone tell the story of their family member who camehere with just a few dollars in their pocket and were able to contribute great things to thiscountry?'

p400
aS"And I believethat it is important for folks generally to assimilate to a common culture in the UnitedStates.And that's exactly what has been happening in the United States of America throughoutour history with immigrants."
p401
aS'What we have seen consistently, and I think thatCongressman Tancredo and I agree, what we have seen is that from time to time there hasbeen this very intense concern about balkanization.'
p402
aS'Benjamin Franklin famously saidthat we should rid Pennsylvania of the Germans in 1751.'
p403
aS'We had the Alien and SeditionAct of 1798, the Chinese Exclusion Act.'

p405
aS'The reason that we have succeeded as a nation, thattoday we are the most powerful economy in the world is that we have been able toovercome those impulses.'
p406
aS'And I believe that we need to continue to overcome thoseimpulses for the future.'
p407
aS"It's also incorrect to say that immigrants only take, and they don'tgive.In 1993, the Urban Institute did a study that found that 94 percent of immigrants were noton welfare and that the distinction between immigrants and natives in terms of who wason welfare was less than three percent."
p408
aS"They also contribute up to $240 billion in taxesoverall into Social Security and Medicare that they're actually never going to get a chanceto use."
p409
aS'And the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few years ago, did ananalysis of 16 different states.'
p410
aS'And they found that in five of those, including some of thebiggest ones, New York and Texas, that there was a net positive from immigrants,including illegal immigrants, versus a negative.'
p411
aS"And so this idea that they don't paytaxes, that they only take, that they're on welfare, the evidence clearly demonstrates thatthat's not the case.I also believe, and I anticipate that some may argue that having so many folks come toour country is not good in terms of crime."

aS'My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department.'
p575
aS'And after I left the Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it.'
p576
aS'But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level.'
p577
aS"And that's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states."
p578
aS'In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state.'
p579
aS"Not all of them passed, but that's an important point."
p580
aS'Every state is a border state now.'
p581
aS'The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold.'
p582
aS"But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there."
p583
aS'The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable.'
p584
aS'My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman.'
p585
aS"He said, it's just obvious."
p586
aS"You can't have open immigration and a welfare state."
p587
aS"You can't have open immigration and a welfare state."
p588
aS'Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience.'
p589
aS"I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that it's here to stay."
p590
aS"And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration."
p591
aS'They were not immigrating into a welfare state.'
p592
aS'They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits.'
p593
aS'There was no safety net to catch them.'
p594
aS'That is a critical distinction that changes everything.'
p595
aS'When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door.'
p596
aS'Now, the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity.'
p597
aS"You come here, you're free to do whatever you can."
p598
aS"You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you."
p599
aS'Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere.'
p600
aS'The golden door represents something completely different.'
p601
aS'Now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so.'
p602
aS'Now, the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net.'
p603
aS"They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined."
p604
aS"19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes."
p605
aS"So that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country."
p606
aS'Now, Julin mentioned this 1993 study.'
p607
aS'I have not seen that study.'
p608
aS"That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then."
p609
aS"Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country."
p610
aS'There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare.'
p611
aS'Now, the explanation for this is obvious.'
p612
aS'It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics.'
p613
aS'Poor people are more likely to consume welfare.'
p614
aS'And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education.'
p615
aS'If you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country.'
p616
aS"Here's another fact to chew on."
p617
aS'The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet.'
p618
aS'There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater.'
p619
aS'That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too.'
p620
aS'So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem.'
p621
aS'Most states have ignored that law.'
p622
aS'New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens.'
p623
aS'New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens.'
p624
aS"Think about that if you are a -- -- well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates."
p625
aS"Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes."
p626
aS'And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states.'
p627
aS'Indeed, I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, and then the states have to pay the burden.'
p628
aS'You can think of story after story about this.'
p629
aS"Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat."
p630
aS'Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income.'
p631
aS"And the city wasn't getting any revenues."
p632
aS'Look what happened.'
p633
aS'All the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population.'
p634
aS'The school districts, the budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year.'
p635
aS'In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million.'
p636
aS'Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district.'
p637
aS'The same thing is happening at the national level.'
p638
aS'And as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost.'
p639
aS'Or take it on the individual level.'
p640
aS'Look at the jobs.'
p641
aS'There are 14 million Americans out of work.'
p642
aS'A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce.'
p643
aS'Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today.'
p644
aS'It actually works.'
p645
aS"But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do."
p646
aS"Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens."
p647
aS"The U.S. citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright."
p648
aS'So if we care about our fiscal health, and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States.'

p756
aS'In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants.'
p757
aS'Onone side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people whocame on The Mayflower.'
p758
aS'So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons.'
p759
aS'One wasthat difference was really kind of what made us great.'
p760
aS'Its certainly what made the twosides of my family great.'
p761
aS'And I learned to understand later it was what made the countrygreat.'
p762
aS'But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this wasanother lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than ourdifferences.And so I see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is tomake sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance, that were getting the benefits of thedifference, but were also holding together as one country.'
p763
aS'And thats where I start whenIm considering immigration.'
p764
aS'Its not -- there have been words thrown around here:nostalgia, generosity, Im not sure anybody mentioned rights, but thats another way thata lot of people come at it.'
p765
aS'I dont come at immigration from any of those perspectives.'
p766
aS'Icome at it from what is in Americas interest.'
p767
aS'Whats really good for us, for oureconomy, for our security, and for our future?'
p768
aS'And thats why Im dead set against thismotion.'
p769
aS'I dont think its good for our economy or for our values.'
p770
aS'So lets start by beinghonest.'
p771
aS'Immigration is about economics.'
p772
aS'Its driven by economics, for the people whoget up in their home villages and come here, and its driven by economics for theAmericans who hire them.'
p773
aS'And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win-win.'
p774
aS'Immigrants create jobs.And contrary to what youve just heard from Kris Kobach, its counterintuitive, I know,but you heard me right.'
p775
aS'Immigrants create jobs.'
p776
aS'Its easy to see how that works on thehigh end.'
p777
aS'The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by peoplewho are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born, the25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who areforeign-born.'
p778
aS'And you heard it from my partner, Julin, the quarter of the tech startupsthat were started by foreign-born.'
p779
aS'As in the past, countries competed -- powerfulcountries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies.'
p780
aS'Today, countries around the worldare competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants.'
p781
aS'But its true at the low end,too, that immigrants create jobs.'
p782
aS'And again, I know this gets even more counterintuitive,but, you know, Ill never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to doexactly what Im doing now ---- hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Marylandtalk about his company.'
p783
aS'He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this.'
p784
aS'He talkedabout how he had a 100-year-old family company.'
p785
aS'The native born people on the EasternShore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work.'
p786
aS'Americans like full -- year-roundjobs.'
p787
aS'No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell.'
p788
aS'Sohe brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- verylow-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers.'
p789
aS'You know, thats the low end of theeconomic totem pole.'
p790
aS'But because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keephis company open in a way that he wouldnt have been able to if he didnt have them.And because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the companyand the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company.'
p791
aS'Andbecause he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in thetown where the tourists came to eat seafood.And because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can getthe picture -- up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totemseafood pickers were keeping an economy going.'
p792
aS'And the point is that on both the topand the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skillladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce.'
p793
aS'The American workforceis changing.'
p794
aS'Were getting older.'
p795
aS'People are -- were having smaller families.'
p796
aS'Peopleare retiring sooner.'
p797
aS'Weve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of theworkforce, and were lucky that theyre filled by immigrants who, because theyredifferent from Americans, either more or less skilled, theyre complementary, notcompetitive.'
p798
aS'They create jobs for Americans.'
p799
aS'Of course, there are costs, and well talkmore about the costs in this -- I dont deny there are costs to immigration, but in the longrun, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad.Our need for workers also changes.'
p800
aS'Thats not so -- in a bad economy, we need fewerforeign workers and in a good economy, we need more.'
p801
aS'But ultimately, the point is thepatents, those PhDs, the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the foodchain.'
p802
aS'And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handlewhat I think is a given of the interconnected world.'
p803
aS"We're lucky immigrants are comingto fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy."
p804
aS"And how are we going tohandle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits,minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values?"
p805

p806
aS'I too am for the rule of law.'
p807
aS'I too am for security andeffective enforcement.'

S'Thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event.'
p821
aS'So, like all of us, Im a descendant of immigrants.'
p822
aS'In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants.'
p823
aS'On one side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people who came on The Mayflower.'
p824
aS'So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons.'
p825
aS'One was that difference was really kind of what made us great.'
p826
aS'Its certainly what made the two sides of my family great.'
p827
aS'And I learned to understand later it was what made the country great.'
p828
aS'But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this was another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our differences.'
p829
aS'And so I see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is to make sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance, that were getting the benefits of the difference, but were also holding together as one country.'
p830
aS'And thats where I start when Im considering immigration.'
p831
aS'Its not -- there have been words thrown around here: nostalgia, generosity, Im not sure anybody mentioned rights, but thats another way that a lot of people come at it.'
p832
aS'I dont come at immigration from any of those perspectives.'
p833
aS'I come at it from what is in Americas interest.'
p834
aS'Whats really good for us, for our economy, for our security, and for our future?'
p835
aS'And thats why Im dead set against this motion.'
p836
aS'I dont think its good for our economy or for our values.'
p837
aS'So lets start by being honest.'
p838
aS'Immigration is about economics.'
p839
aS'Its driven by economics, for the people who get up in their home villages and come here, and its driven by economics for the Americans who hire them.'
p840
aS'And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win- win.'
p841
aS'Immigrants create jobs.'
p842
aS'And contrary to what youve just heard from Kris Kobach, its counterintuitive, I know, but you heard me right.'
p843
aS'Immigrants create jobs.'
p844
aS'Its easy to see how that works on the high end.'
p845
aS'The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by people who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who are foreign-born.'
p846
aS'And you heard it from my partner, Julin, the quarter of the tech startups that were started by foreign-born.'
p847
aS'As in the past, countries competed -- powerful countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies.'
p848
aS'Today, countries around the world are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants.'
p849
aS'But its true at the low end, too, that immigrants create jobs.'
p850
aS'And again, I know this gets even more counterintuitive, but, you know, Ill never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to do exactly what Im doing now -- -- hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Maryland talk about his company.'
p851
aS'He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this.'
p852
aS'He talked about how he had a 100-year-old family company.'
p853
aS'The native born people on the Eastern Shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work.'
p854
aS'Americans like full -- year-round jobs.'
p855
aS'No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell.'
p856
aS'So he brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- very low-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers.'
p857
aS'You know, thats the low end of the economic totem pole.'
p858
aS'But because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keep his company open in a way that he wouldnt have been able to if he didnt have them.'
p859
aS'And because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the company and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company.'
p860
aS'And because he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in the town where the tourists came to eat seafood.'
p861
aS'And because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can get the picture -- up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totem seafood pickers were keeping an economy going.'
p862
aS'And the point is that on both the top and the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill ladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce.'
p863
aS'The American workforce is changing.'
p864
aS'Were getting older.'
p865
aS'People are -- were having smaller families.'
p866
aS'People are retiring sooner.'
p867
aS'Weve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of the workforce, and were lucky that theyre filled by immigrants who, because theyre different from Americans, either more or less skilled, theyre complementary, not competitive.'
p868
aS'They create jobs for Americans.'
p869
aS'Of course, there are costs, and well talk more about the costs in this -- I dont deny there are costs to immigration, but in the long run, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad.'
p870
aS'Our need for workers also changes.'
p871
aS'Thats not so -- in a bad economy, we need fewer foreign workers and in a good economy, we need more.'
p872
aS'But ultimately, the point is the patents, those PhDs, the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the food chain.'
p873
aS'And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle what I think is a given of the interconnected world.'
p874
aS"We're lucky immigrants are coming to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy."
p875
aS"And how are we going to handle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits, minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values?"
p876
aS'And this is really where I differ from my opponents in this debate.'
p877
aS'I too am for the rule of law.'
p878
aS'I too am for security and effective enforcement.'
p879
aS'But I also think we need to be honest about our needs.'
p880
aS'It doesn\'t really work I don\'t think to have two signs at the border, one that says, "Help wanted," -- one that says, "Keep Out" and one that says "Help Wanted.'
p881
aS'" I don\'t think that\'s an honest standup way to go about our business.'
p882
aS"I don't think we want to treat the people who come to work for us -- I think we want to treat them in an honest, standup way."
p883
aS'We don\'t want to say, "Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, come on in" when times are good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave.'
p884
aS"Ultimately, that's what I think today's debate is about."
