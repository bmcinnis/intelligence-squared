S"John Donvan: I'd like to welcome Robert Rosenkranz, CEO of Intelligence Squared U.S..Robert Rosenkranz: Well thank you so much for joining us tonight."
p17
aS'When these debates startedfour years ago, our first resolution was, "We must tolerate a nuclear Iran.'
p18
aS'"Well this could well be the year that Iran gets the bomb.'
p19
aS"And our government's actions suggestthat it is voting for the motion."
p20
aS'Israel on the other hand, might quite rationally decide it cannottolerate a nuclear Iran and take military action to prevent it.'
p21
aS'This is the perhaps the most dramaticand consequential way U.S. and Israeli policy may diverge.'
p22
aS'But there are many others.'
p23
aS"Israel'spriority is its own security, full stop.The U.S. is committed to Israeli security, but it has many conflicting priorities, keeping control ofMiddle East oil out of the hands of Jihadi extremists for one, encouraging the recycling of petrodollars into our vulnerable economy, strengthening ties with moderate Arab regimes, avoidingnuclear proliferation in the region."
p24
aS"U.S. objectives might well be advanced by Israeli-Palestinianor Israeli-Syrian accords on terms Israel doesn't like very much at all.On the other hand, the special relationship has deepened profound roots."
p25
aS"Some is value-driven,reverends for the Holy Land by American Jews and Christians alike, respect for Israel'sdemocratic institutions."
p26
aS'But some is highly strategic.'
p27
aS'Israel is our closest friend and ally in theMiddle East.'
p28
aS'It has, by far, the greatest military capability in the region, and is a major source ofintelligence.And getting back to a nuclear Iran, Israel might well be our best shield.'
p29
aS'Israel did the U.S., in theregion, a favor, I would argue, by bombing the Syrian reactor.'
p30
aS"Maybe it will do the dirty workagain so we don't have to tolerate a nuclear Iran."
p31
aS'Against this complex backdrop, can we say thatby holding hands with Israel, America is shooting itself in the foot?'
p32
aS'Should America step backfrom its special relationship?'
p33
aS"Tonight's debate is to provide some light on this vital issue, and itwill surely provide lots of heat."
p34
aS"So it's my pleasure at this point to turn the proceedings over toour moderator John Donvan and the stellar group of panelists who are going to debate thisresolution."
p35
aS'Thank you.John Donvan: Thank you.'
p36
aS"I'd just like to invite one more round of applause for the gentlemanwho makes all of these debates possible, Robert Rosenkranz.Welcome, everyone, to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.."
p37
aS"I'm John Donvan of ABCNews."
p38
aS"And once again, it's my honor to serve as moderator."
p39
aS'As the floor debaters you seesharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New YorkUniversity.'
p40
aS'Four debaters, two at each table, are debating this motion, "The U.S. should stepback from its special relationship with Israel.'
p41
aS'" And I want to point out, this is a debate.'
p42
aS"It's not apanel discussion."
p43
aS'It is not a seminar.'
p44
aS'This is a debate.'
p45
aS"It's a contest, with winners and losers.And you in our audience have the special role of choosing our winners."
p46
aS'You are the judges in thisdebate.'
p47
aS"And by the time the evening has ended, you will have voted twice, once before and onceafter the debate on whether you agree or disagree with the motion, especially after what you'veheard."
p48
aS'And the team that has changed the most minds at the end of the debate will be declaredour winner.'
p49
aS"So let's go on to our first round of voting."
p50
aS'Once again, the keypads to your seats areyour means to do that.'
p51
aS'If you agree with our motion, "The U.S. should step back from its specialrelationship with Israel", you\'re to push number one.'
p52
aS'If you disagree, a "No" is number two.'
p53
aS"If atthis point, you're undecided that's number three."
p54
aS'You can ignore the other numbers.'
p55
aS'And if youmake a mistake, just correct it and the system will record your last entered number.'
p56
aS"So we'll havethe results of that vote quite shortly."
p57
aS'We go in three rounds.'
p58
aS'We have opening statements ofapproximately seven minutes each.'
p59
aS'Then we go on to a middle section where the debaters talkdirectly to one another, prompted also by questions from myself and from you in the audience.And then at the end of the evening, each team has two minutes of closing remarks.'
p60
aS'On to roundone then, let the debate begin.'
p61
aS'Our first debater, for the motion, "The U.S. should step back fromits special relationship with Israel", is Roger Cohen who will make his way to his lectern.'
p62
aS'Rogeris a former foreign editor of The New York Times, a journalist who has traveled the world, whohas himself the interesting story, you are Cohen, because when your dad left South Africa andmoved to the UK, he was advised that it will be a good idea to change his name from Cohen.And his answer was -Roger Cohen: His answer was - he suggested maybe Einstein.'
p63
aS'He stuck with Cohen and itworked.John Donvan: That\'s why tonight, I brought you Cohen, arguing for the motion, "The U.S.should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p64
aS'"Roger Cohen: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.'
p65
aS'In life, when we fail, we call it stupidity toburrow deeper into failure.'
p66
aS'Measured by any standard, American policy toward Israel has failedover the past couple of decades.'
p67
aS'We are no closer to any kind of peace.'
p68
aS'Israelis and Palestinianstoday stand further apart than ever.'
p69
aS'They are estranged.'
p70
aS'They are mistrustful.'
p71
aS'They areantagonistic.'
p72
aS'They can scarcely even imagine peace.'
p73
aS'We will therefore submit to you tonightthat rather than burrowing deeper into failure, and so jeopardizing American interest, the UnitedStates should reconsider its ties with Israel.'
p74
aS'It should step back from its special relationship infavor of a normal relationship.'
p75
aS'Now a normal relations between allies, and the United States andIsrael must remain firm allies, are often marked by differences.'
p76
aS"With France, with Japan, withGermany, with Turkey, important allies all, America has regular and often open disagreements.What makes America's relationship with Israel is its uncritical nature, even when U.S. interestsare being hurt."
p77
aS'What also makes the relationship special is the incredible largess that the UnitedStates shows towards Israel, over the past decade, $28.9 billion in economic aid.'
p78
aS"And on top ofthat, another $30 billion in military aid, that's almost $60 billion."
p79
aS"That's 10 times the GNP ofHaiti that is being gifted to a small country."
p80
aS'Now, I ask you, to what end is this money beingused.'
p81
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, we would submit that it ends often inimical to the America interest.Take the ongoing Israeli settlement program in the West Bank, at a cost of about $100 billion,this enterprise has grown the number of settlers in the West Bank from about 140,000 in 1996, toabout 300,000 today.'
p82
aS"If you add the roughly 150,000 Israeli's in East Jerusalem, you get to anumber of 450,000 Israelis beyond the 1997 border."
p83
aS"That's not all."
p84
aS'Money has poured into arepressive apparatus involving settler-only highways, reserved military areas, a separation orsecurity barrier.'
p85
aS'The Israelis call it "separation wall", "hated separated wall" the Palestinians callit, a barrier that burrows into the West Bank and annexes 10% of the land.'
p86
aS"What's the result ofthis?"
p87
aS'Well the result is an isolated, fragmented, atomized, fractured, humiliated Palestinianpresence that simply makes a nonsense, at first, of the notion of "Two States for Two Peoples".What I observe there on my visits to the West Bank amounts to a kind of primer in colonialism.Imagine, Israelis in their fast cars, Blackberry-ing away, booming down these super highways,while Palestinians on their donkey carts make their way on dirt tracks, if they can get there, totheir orchards.'
p88
aS'This is a primer in colonialism, much more than it resembles a nascent Palestinianstate.'
p89
aS'Yet, "Two States for Two Peoples" is the declared U.S. objective.'
p90
aS'In effect, the UnitedStates is bankrolling the very Israeli policies that are dashing its own aims and the hopes for Osloby making two states almost unimaginable.'
p91
aS'Does this make sense?'
p92
aS'Is that clever?'
p93
aS"I don't think so.And if you don't think so, ladies and gentlemen, you should vote for the proposition tonight.Now, the United States has raised its voice occasionally."
p94
aS'Jim Baker, for example, Secretary ofState in \'89, said, "Foreswear annexation.'
p95
aS'Stop settlement activity.'
p96
aS'"Now fast forward two decades to Barack Obama, in Cairo, two decades in several hundredthousand settlers, he said, "The United States does not accept legitimacy of the continued Israelisettlements.'
p97
aS'" And what did Prime Minister Netanyahu do two weeks ago, planted settlings invarious settlements, and they are part - and said, "They are part of Israel for all eternity.'
p98
aS'" Now ina normal relationship, there would be consequences to such defiance.'
p99
aS'In a special relationship,the one that exists, there are no such consequences.'
p100
aS"Now, America's perceived complicity inIsraeli violence carries a heavy price."
p101
aS'Jihadi terrorism aimed at the United States is not primarilymotivated perhaps by the Palestinian issue, but it is a major factor.'
p102
aS'It is a potent terroristrecruitment tool.'
p103
aS'The United States should stand by its allies.'
p104
aS'And Israel is an ally.'
p105
aS'But ifAmerica is to pay the blood, and the treasure, and the last piece of mind that comes withsupporting Israel, it should be ready at least to speak openly and critically of Israeli mistakeswhen needed.'
p106
aS"To boost, ladies and gentlemen, are unhealthy, a climate that affixes charges ofanti-Semitism to anyone critical of Israel, and self-hating Jew to any Jew who's critical of Israel,is unhelpful."
p107
aS'For if there are not two states, there will be one state.And sooner or later, the number of Palestinians in it will outnumber the number of Jews.'
p108
aS'Andwhat then will remain of the Zionist dream?'
p109
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, there's also a moral issuehere."
p110
aS'I am a Jew.'
p111
aS'I know that Israel at its foundation and its declaration of independence said itwould, "Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespectiveof religion, race, and sex.'
p112
aS'" We, Jews, know in our bones what persecution is.'
p113
aS'Alas, and this ishard to say, Israel, has in my view, lost touch with these fundamental values.'
p114
aS'By uncriticallysupporting Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, America is undermining its own values,which at the very least stand for the absence of second class citizenship and equality ofopportunity.'
p115
aS"Yes, I know Israel's a vibrant democracy isolated in the Middle East."
p116
aS'And its valuesare closer to ours than those at closed Arab societies.'
p117
aS"But that does not mean that we shouldendorse Israel's systematic dismemberment of the Two State option."
p118
aS"And if President Obama isserious about reaching out to the Muslim world, America must appear much more as an honestbroker and less as Israel's spokesman."
p119
aS'And that requires a serious re-balloting.'
p120
aS'You will, Isuspect, hear that Israel is a lonely David facing an Arab Goliath.'
p121
aS'You will hear that it needsblanket American support to be secure.'
p122
aS'This is simply not true.'
p123
aS"Nuclear-armed Israel ispowerful.John Donvan: Roger Cohen, your time is up.Roger Cohen: The United States can step back while ensuring Israel's security."
p124
aS'And so I urgeyou to vote for the motion tonight.'
p125
aS'Thank you.John Donvan: Thank you, Roger Cohen.'
p126
aS'Our motion is, "The U.S. should step back from itsspecial relationship with Israel", and arguing first against the motion, Stuart Eizenstat, who hasbeen a former ambassador to the European Union, but his career in government is astounding.When you go through his resume, he has had undersecretary positions in Commerce, in Treasury,in the State Department.'
p127
aS"You didn't get Agriculture?"
p128
aS'Not a farmer, ladies and gentlemen, StuartEizenstat.Stuart Eizenstat: Thank you, John.'
p129
aS"I couldn't disagree more with Roger Cohen, and stronglyoppose the notion that the United States should somehow stand back from its special relationshipwith Israel, and I do so for the following reasons."
p130
aS'First, if the United States would do so, it wouldbetray the very principles upon which U.S. foreign policy is based.'
p131
aS'Unlike China, or Russia, orsome of our European allies, our foreign policies since our founding founders have never been toavoid a morality.'
p132
aS'Indeed, morality is a central feature of our policy.'
p133
aS"As a first country torecognize Israel in 1947 after the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews, we would be betraying thoseprinciples were we to step back from the special relationship we've developed over 62 years.Second, it would mean abandoning the only democratic, loyal, reliable ally in the region, whichshares American values of democracy, rights for women, judicial independence, freedom ofspeech, and forming a 21st century culture."
p134
aS"It's the only state in the region, which has a vibrantnon-governmental sector so good on policies that Roger mentioned."
p135
aS"There are groups like PeaceNow, BTselem, and others who are vibrantly and publicly opposing those policies, the onlycountry in the region which permits that kind of debate and criticism of the government.In addition, it's not just American values, it is American interest."
p136
aS'Israel shares American interestin combating terrorism, in creating pro-Western moderate Arab states in the region, in stoppingnuclear proliferation, and in having peace with all of its neighbors.'
p137
aS'In addition, if we were towithdraw that special relationship, it would be a sign of American inconstancy and weakness.What message would it send to other allies?'
p138
aS'Would they think they were going to be next on thechopping block?'
p139
aS"And indeed, to do so would only lead to more demands from those in the region.America has to stand behind its allies because if it doesn't, it will not have many left anywhere.In addition, the whole notion of this motion misunderstands the major issues facing the UnitedStates in the region."
p140
aS'And I have spent an enormous amount of time and energy in that region inmultiple capacities.'
p141
aS'Issues that we have with Iraq and Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, terroristgroups like Al-Qaeda are unrelated to our special relationship with Israel.'
p142
aS'Indeed, what is goingon fundamentally in these states is a contest internally within the Arab world betweenmodernizing states and radical Islamic states who want to create an Islamic caliphate for thewhole region, unrelated to Israel, unrelated to Israel.'
p143
aS"It's also auspicious argument that somehowthere's a zero-sum game that the kind of outreach that President Obama properly is providing tothe Muslim world is somehow inconsistent with a special relationship with Israel."
p144
aS'And let me tellyou from personal knowledge, there is no zero-sum game.'
p145
aS'We can, and do have, both.'
p146
aS'We havea very close relationship.'
p147
aS'And I spent a lot of time in countries like Egypt and in Jordan, and inthe territories, and in the Gulf helping build that relationship.'
p148
aS'And indeed, let me point out that itis because of the special relationship with Israel that the Arab states know that the way in whichIsrael will make concessions is when it has a dependable American ally so that it can make thoseterritorial concessions.'
p149
aS"And I've seen it happen at Camp David under President Carter, all ofSinai given back."
p150
aS"I've seen it happen with Jordan and the peace agreement with Jordan."
p151
aS"Rogersays there's been no peace."
p152
aS"I mean, I don't know where you've been."
p153
aS'How about the Egyptianpeace, which has lasted now for over 30 years, and the Jordanian peace?'
p154
aS'And those concessionscontinued.For example, Prime Minister Barack in the Clinton administration, in which I served at thesecond Camp David, offered 95% of the land, including East Jerusalem, to Yasser Arafat.'
p155
aS'Andwhat was the response?'
p156
aS"No, that's where the second intifada occurred."
p157
aS'What was the responsewhen Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza?'
p158
aS'What was the response?'
p159
aS'Rockets from Gaza,dismantling the settlements, dismantling 3,000 people, and that was the response.'
p160
aS'So it isauspicious argument that we can only have good relations with the Muslim world if we abandonIsrael.'
p161
aS'Indeed, they know we need to have that relationship to convince Israel to make thoseconcessions.'
p162
aS'In addition, where else will one have a special relationship and with whom else?The Saudis?'
p163
aS'The Saudis who export Wahabanism as well as expensive oil from whom 17 of the19 9/11 terrorists came?'
p164
aS"Would it be Egypt where I've spent a great deal of time?"
p165
aS'I think we needstronger relations with Israel.'
p166
aS"It's on forth with Egypt."
p167
aS"It's a one-party state, 28 years the samepresident."
p168
aS'The opposition candidate was arrested when he ran against Mr. Mubarak.Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, where is the special relationship?'
p169
aS'And let me close with thisthought, when you say, "Why don\'t we have peace with the Palestinians?'
p170
aS'" If there were a MartinLuther King, if there were a Mahatma Gandhi leading the Palestinian movement, they would havehad statehood long, long, long ago.'
p171
aS'It is because there is no reliable Palestinian partner.'
p172
aS'It isbecause of the Hamas-Fatah problem.'
p173
aS'It is because when the Israeli public sees a withdrawalfrom Lebanon or a withdrawal on their own from Gaza, instead of reconciliation, they get rocketsin response.'
p174
aS"That's why we don't have peace, not because Israel doesn't want peace."
p175
aS'And last,there are certain things with which we disagree with Israel as we do with all allies, settlementpolicy and so forth.'
p176
aS"I didn't notice, for example, that Germany, or the UK, or France is providingthe kind of troops we want in Afghanistan."
p177
aS'You can have a special relationship with allies andnot always agree.'
p178
aS'Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote against this pernicious motion, whichwould undercut the very basis of foreign policy in the United States.John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat, your time is up.Stuart Eizenstat: The only bipartisan foreign policy which we have in this country.'
p179
aS'Thank you.John Donvan: All right.'
p180
aS"Here's where we are."
p181
aS'We are halfway through the opening round of thishave two teams of two facing it out over this motion, "The U.S. should step back from its specialrelationship with Israel".'
p182
aS"You've heard the first two debaters."
p183
aS'Now we move on to the third.'
p184
aS"I'dlike to introduce Rashid Khalidi who is a professor at Columbia University, a former adviser tothe Palestinian delegation for the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations."
p185
aS'He was in Beirut during theIsraeli bombing in 1982.'
p186
aS"He comes from - New York born, comes from a storied Jerusalemfamily who has bequeathed to the city of Jerusalem one of the world's leading libraries of Islamicliterature, started by your grandfather, I believe?Rashid Khalidi: Yes.John Donvan: Ladies and gentlemen, Rashid Khalidi.Rashid Khalidi: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
p187
aS'Thank you for braving the impendingsnowstorm.'
p188
aS"You've heard from our opponents, one of our opponents, a pattern that we've heard agreat deal of."
p189
aS'And if you listen to the advocates of the special relationship with Israel, you wouldthink that all is for the best and the best of all possible worlds.'
p190
aS"Well I'm here to tell you that it'snot."
p191
aS'You heard from my colleague, Roger, exactly how bad the situation is.'
p192
aS'I stronglyrecommend the next time any of you have a chance to go to the Holy Land, that you take a littletime away from your trip to Israel and spend some time in the West Bank, spend three or fourdays.'
p193
aS'And you will see precisely how bad it is.'
p194
aS'Now, I would be the last person, as a Middle Easthistorian, to suggest that all the problems in the Middle East are caused by the U.S. specialrelationship with Israel.'
p195
aS"They're not."
p196
aS'There are problems with Arab governments.'
p197
aS'There areproblems among the Palestinians.'
p198
aS'There are problems inside Israel.'
p199
aS'But some problems arecaused by this special relationship.'
p200
aS'Let me just list a couple of them.'
p201
aS'One of them is that there is,as a result in large measure of our special relationship with Israel, an almost total deafness topublic opinion in Palestine and in the Arab world.'
p202
aS"We hear the same kind of mantra about there'sno democracy, there's no public sector."
p203
aS'There are all kinds of things going on in public opinion inthe Arab world.'
p204
aS"And one of the things that's going on is a deep distrust and unease with U.S.policy over this issue in particular."
p205
aS'A second thing that has to be said is that there is a suspicion,in public opinion in particular all over the Arab world, of the fact that the United States in theMiddle East because of this special relationship is not and cannot be an honest broker.Everybody knows that the United States engages in prior coordination with Israel, as a result ofan agreement made by Secretary Kissinger back in the 70s, before anything starts between Arabsand Israelis.'
p206
aS"Everybody knows, in other words, that there's a big fat U.S. thumb on the scaleswhen the United States act as a mediator."
p207
aS'I recall, in the negotiations in Washington, we were inan impasse with the Israeli side, and we were told, after much reluctance on their part, that theState Department of the United States would come with a bridging proposal.'
p208
aS'We were verypleased.'
p209
aS'They came with a bridging proposal that was worse than the position that the Israelishad offered us.'
p210
aS'This is what the special relationship gives you.'
p211
aS'It gives you a country that cannotact as an honest broker.'
p212
aS'And let me say something about United States reliability.Let me say something about what the United States looks like after 20 years when Americanpresidents, since President Carter, have said not just that they were going to make peace withEgypt, which they did, but that they were going to make peace between the Palestinians and theIsraelis.'
p213
aS'We have systematically failed in this effort over the past 20 years.'
p214
aS'The situation is - 30years in fact.'
p215
aS'The situation is infinitely worse today than when Ambassador Rabinovich and Iwent to Madrid in October of 1991.'
p216
aS"It's worse for the Palestinians."
p217
aS"It's worse for the position theUnited States in the Arab world if you care not what autocratic governments think, but what thepeople think about us."
p218
aS'And this brings me to the main reason you should vote for thisproposition.'
p219
aS'You should vote for this proposition, in our opinion, because the United Statesshould be true to its principles.'
p220
aS'It should be fair.'
p221
aS'It should be equitable.'
p222
aS'It should be just.'
p223
aS'Wegive, as Roger said, $60 billion over the past 10 years to Israel.'
p224
aS'We are in effect engaged insupporting an occupation that has been going on for 42 years and counting.'
p225
aS'We are in effectunderwriting settlements.'
p226
aS"And we're not just using that with U.S. money that's fund - U.S. taxdollars out of our pockets that's fungible."
p227
aS'We are doing that with tax deductible contributions tosettlements, to projects in the occupied West Bank, and essentially to doing things that aredirectly opposed to United States policy and to the interest of the United States not to speak of theinterest of peace in the Middle East.'
p228
aS'We hear a great deal about security whenever Israel is talkedabout.'
p229
aS"We have to be concerned with Israel's security."
p230
aS'Fine, we have to be concerned with thesecurity of everybody in this region if we are going to be an honest broker, if some people are notof a higher importance to us than other people.'
p231
aS'What about the security of Palestinians?'
p232
aS"In therecent war in Gaza, it wasn't really a war."
p233
aS'It was a one-sided affair.'
p234
aS'There were 14,000 peoplekilled on one side and 14 on the other side.'
p235
aS"If we're concerned with human security, we should beconcerned with numbers like this."
p236
aS'We should be concerned with the fact that everybody knowsthat we are engaged not just in funding, financing, supporting diplomatically, but also in sellingweapons that are engaged in doing these kinds of things.'
p237
aS'Now what can the United States do?'
p238
aS'Inmy view, it can do many things.'
p239
aS'It\'s not enough to say, "Oh, it\'s a shame.'
p240
aS'The Palestinians aredivided.'
p241
aS'" The Palestinians are divided.'
p242
aS'They have deep, deep internal divisions.'
p243
aS'The UnitedStates has been working systematically to deepen those divisions.'
p244
aS"The United States should behelping to unite the Palestinians around a consensus whereby they can come forward andnegotiate, rather than trying to keep them divided as we've been trying to do if our objective is notto weaken them, which is an Israeli objective."
p245
aS'If our objective is peace, then there has to be notjust an Israeli consensus for peace, there has to be a Palestinian consensus for peace.'
p246
aS'We havedone everything possible to prevent this.'
p247
aS'This is one thing that we can and should do.'
p248
aS'What elsecan we do?'
p249
aS'I would argue that our policy should be linked not solely to what the stronger party -by far the stronger party in this relationship wants.'
p250
aS'That is no way to make peace.'
p251
aS'Again andagain, what the United States has an effect done is to help gang up on the Palestinians.'
p252
aS'TheUnited States has to pull away from this special relationship with Israel if it is to play any kind ofeffective role in making peace.'
p253
aS'Now, this is particularly true because the hardest issues betweenthe Palestinians and the Israelis, much harder than anything that had to be dealt with betweenIsrael and Jordan or Israel and Egypt have to do with issues that resonate all over the Arab world,things like refugees, things like Jerusalem.'
p254
aS'These are not easy issues.'
p255
aS"If we stand with thestronger, as we have done consistently on these and other issues, if we stand with Israel andignore the fact that these are not just things on which there's a claim on both sides, but mostimportantly, these are things that will negatively affect U.S. interests."
p256
aS'If we take a one-sidedposition, we are harming U.S. interests throughout the region.'
p257
aS'If you vote against thisproposition, I would argue, you are voting for the status quo.'
p258
aS'You are voting for more of thesame.'
p259
aS'You are voting for a peace process that has delivered a lot of process and no peace.'
p260
aS'Andthat is what we have gotten from every administration up to this point.'
p261
aS'We have peace withEgypt.'
p262
aS'We have with Jordan.'
p263
aS'Peace with the Palestinians is much farther away.'
p264
aS'I would suggestthat voting for this status quo is to say in effect, "We\'re going to bury our heads in the sand.We\'re going to allow a Two States solution to disappear.'
p265
aS'" I personally don\'t think it has verymany changes anymore.'
p266
aS'But if this is something that is important, if we do not want the futurefor Israel that many Israelis see, where Israel continues to rule over the Palestinians, we shouldvote in favor of this proposition.'
p267
aS'Thank you very much.John Donvan: Our motion is, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship withIsrael".'
p268
aS'And our last debater, arguing against this motion, Itamar Rabinovich is a former IsraeliAmbassador to the United States.'
p269
aS'He was on the White House lawn when Yitzhak Rabin andYasser Arafat shook hands.'
p270
aS'He has seen what he felt Israeli locations peace come here.'
p271
aS'His bookon "The Brink of Peace" was about his involvement in negotiations with the Syrians.'
p272
aS'It went tothe brink, and then pulled back.'
p273
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, Itamar Rabinovich.Itamar Rabinovich: Thank you.'
p274
aS'I urge you strongly to vote against the motion.'
p275
aS"I think that themotion indicates a desire to destroy the United States' most important, most successfulrelationship in a very important part of the world."
p276
aS'What does special relationship mean?'
p277
aS'It doesnot mean that the tail is wagging the dog.It is a mutual relationship.'
p278
aS'I was an ambassador to Washington for nearly four years.'
p279
aS'I was apeace negotiator that worked very closely with the United States peace team.'
p280
aS'And I know howmany disagreements we have had over the years with our American colleagues.'
p281
aS'How manytimes, what we call, pressure was brought to bear on Israeli decision makers, even presidents whowere considered very friendly.'
p282
aS'Bill Clinton, considered a great friend of Israel, he was a closefriend of Yitzhak Rabin.'
p283
aS"He admired Rabin, but I've seen them argue fiercely."
p284
aS"And I've seenRabin yield to Clinton because he was the President of the United States, the senior partner in thisspecial relationship."
p285
aS'Now, what is special about the relationship?'
p286
aS"It's special."
p287
aS"It's unique becauseyou have unusual loyalty on both sides."
p288
aS'We have many relationships around the world as wehave mentioned.'
p289
aS'Israel relationship with France is so close.'
p290
aS"Doesn't France undermine U.S.interests and policies in parts of the world?"
p291
aS"Japan is a close ally, look at the arguments you'rehaving with Japan over stationing of U.S. troops in Japan."
p292
aS'You will not have such an argumentwith Israel because there are no U.S. troops stationed in Israel.'
p293
aS"It's a very close military andstrategic alliance defined, among other things, by the fact that Israel does not want Americantroops to be stationed in Israel."
p294
aS"Israel wants to look out for its own security with American help,with American weapons and equipment, but on its own, and not having to station troops in Israelor in that part of the Middle East because Israel is there, it's a huge advantage."
p295
aS'Because look atthe other side of the Middle East, an important part of the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, SaudiArabia, Iraq, Iran, countries that are of enormous influence or importance for the United States.You have troops there.'
p296
aS'You have many American troops at a huge cost in Iraq.'
p297
aS'You have troopsin Afghanistan.'
p298
aS'You have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.'
p299
aS'And remember, what did the Al-Qaeda terrorists say once they exploded into the World Trade Center, the first reason they citedfor the U.S. - for attacking the U.S. is that the United States has troops on sacred Muslim soil inthe Arabian peninsula.'
p300
aS"In Israel or near Israel, you don't need to station U.S. troops."
p301
aS"It's a veryclose alliance."
p302
aS"It's an alliance based on mutuality, on a full loyalty on both sides, acceptance of,of course, the seniority of the United States in that relationship."
p303
aS'And this relationship serves youin an area in which many American interests are focused.'
p304
aS'Now, the argument of the people whoput this for a vote, the argument of our opponents in this debate is that support to Israelundermines American position in our republic opinion and reinforces Arab and Muslim tendencyto terrorism against the United States.'
p305
aS'Wrong.'
p306
aS'What the Arabs resent most is, that is Americanmilitary presence, American support for dictatorial regimes.'
p307
aS'Let me read a very perceptivecomment written awhile ago.'
p308
aS'Iraq has changed everything in Washington, the city obsessed withthe President.'
p309
aS'It was easy to forget that as recently as a few years ago, the United States was notparticularly disliked in the Middle East, and that Al-Qaeda was a tiny underground organizationwith almost no popular support, very perceptive professor Khalidi who wrote these lines.'
p310
aS'So weare in agreement on a few things but we take different conclusions from that.'
p311
aS'So anothercomplaint that I have against our opponents in this debate, first of all too much was focused onthe Palestinian issue.'
p312
aS"It's very important issue, it's important first and foremost for us."
p313
aS"I'm one ofthose Israelis who desperately believe in fight for having a two state solution."
p314
aS"I think it'sdangerous for Israel to keep the states poor."
p315
aS'Now there are people in Israel who think otherwiseand politically we disagree.'
p316
aS'In the United States and this Government of Israel do want to see atwo state solution.'
p317
aS'But the President problem is not the only one.'
p318
aS'He said there is peace withEgypt, there is peace with Jordan and normal relations with quite a few Arab countries and thathas been achieved by the United States precisely as my colleague Stu Eizenstat said, because theUnited States is the power, the great power that has the ability to influence to work with Israel.And Arab countries who want to see a change.'
p319
aS'Syria if it wants the Golan back knows that theirroad to the Golan leads to Washington, not through Tehran.'
p320
aS'So, actually the closest to Israel, theperception in the Arab world that the United States has that sway with Israel is one of the mostimportant assets that United States has.'
p321
aS'And believe me I spent hundreds of hours talking to theSyrians as the peace negotiator with Syria, and I know exactly full well.'
p322
aS'They wanted to makepeace with Israel because that was a pathway to Washington.'
p323
aS'They work with Washington, youknow, that to make peace with Israel.'
p324
aS'Finally much of what you heard from our opponents earlierthis evening was actually in the frame of the Bush years.'
p325
aS'We are not in the Bush years any more.For year there has been another administration in Washington and actually what we have seen itwas President Obama who listened to such advice and begun by taking some distance from Israel.He went to Cairo; he gave the speech to the Muslim world.'
p326
aS"He didn't go to Israel."
p327
aS'What is theresult, the result is the current impulse.'
p328
aS'It was a mistake to take even one step, because the voicesthat we heard from the Arab world was you took one step go all the way, that is a mistake.'
p329
aS'So thepolicy should be stay with the special relationship with Israel and together with Israel, use it inorder to make peace with the Middle East including with the Palestinians.John Donvan: And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where themotion being argued is the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p330
aS'And wenow have the results of our live audience vote.We asked you before the debate begun where you stood on our motion the U.S. should step backfrom its special relationship with Israel before the debate began here is word stood 33% of youwere for the motion, 42% against and 25% were undecided.'
p331
aS'Now one to round two, ended roundtwo the debaters is going to address one another directly.'
p332
aS'I will asks some questions of them andwe will come to you and the audience to ask the questions and I once again want to urge you verymuch like a participation but we ask you to think in terms of the question, think in terms ofsomething that you can say in 40 seconds, think in terms of something has question mark in theend and that is also on topic.'
p333
aS'But I where I want to begin this, I want to go to the side that isarguing against the motion which argued in part particularly Stuart Eizenstat who served in somany administrations and was involve in this region.'
p334
aS'Argued that turning away from Israel at thispoint would be an immoral act because Israel has been such a loyal ally for so long and I want toput to that side to either gentleman the question.'
p335
aS'So what would actually happen to Israel if theU.S.'
p336
aS'created more distance?Stuart Eizenstat: Well, what would happen is that the United States would lose the levers andinfluence it has, and it has used to encourage Israel to make the concessions that it is made.'
p337
aS"It'sinconceivable for example that Israel would have given up all the sign at Camp David one withPresident Carter to each."
p338
aS"If it didn't know that the United States was solidly and affirmably in itscorner and the same is true with respect to other concessions that Israel made."
p339
aS"These depend on amutuality of interest and what I'll mention John and my closing points is the very specificconcrete benefits that relationship with Israel provides to the United States."
p340
aS'They are veryconcrete from intelligent sharing, to missile technology sharing to standing shoulder-to-shoulderto oppose Iranian nuclear threats.'
p341
aS'So the interests are not just values, they are profound U.S.national security interest, but again, the direct answer to your question is, it would send a signal toIsrael of inconsistency as it would be less likely make concessions - but they would say the sameto all other allies, but what it would say -John Donvan: But would it be harmful for Israel is one of the questions -Stuart Eizenstat: It would very harmful for Israel because Israel would be completely alone.Where else does it have a very close relationship?'
p342
aS'To whom else would it turn for support?'
p343
aS'Imean in the 1967 war, at the maximum time of their danger, all right when the state was almosteliminated by all the Arab countries, their prime arms supplier was not the United States ofAmerica, it was France.'
p344
aS'And in the midst of the war, that arms shipments were totally cut off, a100% cut off.'
p345
aS'So Israel has nowhere else to turn as a major ally other than the United States, itwould feel increasingly isolated.'
p346
aS"It would be much more intractable in terms of the peace process,and I think it would be a terrible thing both for Israel and for the United States.John Donvan: To the other side, is it an act of betrayal to put distance-Roger Cohen: No, it's not an act of betrayal."
p347
aS'With respects to nobody is arguing for a divorcehere.'
p348
aS'Nobody is arguing that Israel should cease being an ally of the United States.'
p349
aS"So, we aresimply arguing that when President Obama says that he wants settlements to stop and settlementscontinue and Prime Minister Netanyahu declares that some settlements are Israel's for all eternity,that there should be consequences, and I believe that if the United States were firmer if it madeclear to Israel that there are indeed consequences, then Israel would measure its actions muchmore carefully and there would be more chance of getting a resumption of Israeli-Palestiniantalks, which are currently paralyzed."
p350
aS'Israel, if it thinks it can act with complete impunity is notgoing to be responsive to U.S. desires.John Donvan: Let me go to Itamar, he is looking at-Itamar Rabinovich: Briefly I like to say of course, it would not be good for Israel if the U.S.walked away from the special relationship.'
p351
aS'There would be both substantive and a perceptionissue of weakening Israel.'
p352
aS'Israel would go to the right, maybe to the radical right.'
p353
aS'My point whatis going to happen to the United States.'
p354
aS"Now, let me read sentence from the most unlikely source.If you go this week's New Yorker, Seymour Hersh discussion with Bashar Assad, the President ofSyria, says, now the problem is that the United States is weaker and whole - in financial world, isweak as world."
p355
aS'You always need power to do politics and nobody is doing politics.'
p356
aS'What youneed is a strong United States with good politics not weaker United States.'
p357
aS"For United States itwalks away from Israel it sends the signal of weakness inconsistent, it's not going to be good forU.S."
p358
aS'policy.John Donvan: Rashid KhalidiRashid Khalidi: I think this is like telling us when you are deep hole, the thing to do is digdeeper.'
p359
aS'I mean we have enabled, we have enabled, the worst instincts of Israel politics.'
p360
aS'We haveenabled and supported and financed the worst policies in terms of, leave aside American interest.We are all Americans that should be the only thing that matters to us.'
p361
aS'Israeli interest, why isoccupation and settlement in the Israeli interest?'
p362
aS'Ambassador Rabinovich is opposed, is anopponent of these things.'
p363
aS'Most right thinking Israelis that most of know are but Israeli politics ismoving exactly the opposite direction.'
p364
aS'What we are doing is enabling these tendencies.'
p365
aS'Let mesay one other thing about constancy.'
p366
aS'When we are doing something that everybody in the worldthink is dominant.'
p367
aS'The idea of staying the course does not make us look constant, it makes uslook dumb.'
p368
aS'And our allies we were asked rhetorically by one of my opponents, if United Statesmoved away from the special relationship what will happen with some of our allies, they wouldapplaud.'
p369
aS'They see the United States as systematically weakening itself by this perverse specialrelationship.John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat, what about that very point that our allies would actually applaudreadjustment to number of relationships?Stuart Eizenstat: Two things.'
p370
aS'First of all when Roger says he is not calling for a divorce, okay.Sometimes it difficult for spouses and countries to tell the difference between a separation and adivorce.'
p371
aS'The implications can be the same.'
p372
aS'And second, I was ambassador to the EuropeanUnion.'
p373
aS'I have spent an enormous amount of time in Europe.'
p374
aS'I can tell you that it would send achill down the spine of every ally we have in Europe and around the world if this relationshipwere abandoned.'
p375
aS'Because they would say, we will next on chopping block.'
p376
aS'It would a terribleside of inconstancy what the world wants is a strong constant United States that stands behind itsprinciples, that stands behind its value and stands behinds its allies.Roger Cohen: If I may-John Donvan: Roger Cohen.Roger Cohen: With respect I also spend a lot time in the European Union not as an ambassador.And my perception of European publics and European governments is that many are bewilderedby the extent and degree of U.S. support for Israel and would applaud some modification of thatrelationship.John Donvan: The side arguing for the motion I said that made a rather cogent argument, quitelogical that U.S. relationship with Israel raises the question whether the United States can be anhonest broker in the Middle East.'
p377
aS'What - take that on either side-against the motions.Stuart Eizenstat: We both seen it from different perspective myself and United States perspectiveand get is really perspective.'
p378
aS'Every moderate care country knows that only the UnitedStates can talk to both sides.'
p379
aS'It is the only honest broker.'
p380
aS'And indeed if it were to withdraw fromthat special relationship it would lose the capacity to have then ear of the Israelis in a way it doesnow.'
p381
aS"It is an honest broker that's why even though there is a quartet with the UN and Russia andso forth and the EU."
p382
aS"It's only the United States, the Secretaries of State, the President who werethe active ingredients in the Peace process."
p383
aS'The Arab states know that, Europeans know that,Israelis know that, and so we are accepted as the honest broker.'
p384
aS'And again, I think that Itamar isright, you are retreading Bush, we have got a different President who has reached out to theMuslim world and who said entire world, yes, we want to have stronger relationships with theMuslim world.'
p385
aS"Yes, we want to have a two states solution but yes we stand firmly behind thestate of Israel as a Jewish State, that's being an honest broker and that's what accepted on allsides.John Donvan: Does the other side agree that President Obama is changing the game?Rashid Khalidi: I'd actually like to say something about this honest broker thing."
p386
aS"I don't thinkUnited States in any way an honest broker."
p387
aS'United States is quite frequently the only brokerbecause United States hugs the stage.'
p388
aS'Look at what the United States does to the quartet, itessentially tries to turn them into bunch of oodles who will follow the American lead, itsuccessfully does that quite frequently even with European Union and with the Russians.'
p389
aS'And Ithink this is actually a problem.'
p390
aS'We have seen more constructive diplomacy in the Middle Eastfrom Qatar and Turkey; incidentally an important Democratic ally.A country with a public sphere.'
p391
aS'A major ally over decades going back to launching of NATO.The only democracy in the Middle East is not Israel.'
p392
aS'And we have seen more constructivediplomacy from those two countries than we have seen from the United States over the pastseveral years as far as brokering a peace between or trying to broker a peace.'
p393
aS"For example,arranging a settlement of the conflict in Lebanon, and I would suggest that it is in the UnitedStates' interest to bring others in."
p394
aS"It's in the United States interest to make this a multilateralsettlement."
p395
aS'James Baker, to his enormous credit, understood this.'
p396
aS"And that's one of the mostimportant achievements of Madrid."
p397
aS'It was to bring other parties in, that United States has thistendency to monopolize things.'
p398
aS"It is a tendency to be resistant.John Donvan: Do you see President Obama changing the game?Roger Cohen: I think the president's problem at the moment is that he's gone a long way in wordswith the Cairo speech, with the speech in Istanbul, with other gestures."
p399
aS'But when it comes toactions, and people are looking at actions, I think the Palestinians tend to see more of the same.And that is the issue here.'
p400
aS'Can we be imaginative?'
p401
aS'Can we think outside of the box?'
p402
aS'Look, whenthe Oslo Accord came in the 1990s, the PLO Charter still existed.'
p403
aS'It existed until 1996 in itsoriginal form calling for the annihilation of Israel.'
p404
aS'Now did this stop the imaginative negotiatorsin the 1990s from moving that process forward.'
p405
aS'Oslo was 1993; this was done while the charterstill existed.'
p406
aS'The Hamas charter calling for annihilation of Israel is vile.'
p407
aS'It is unacceptable.'
p408
aS'Butcan we think outside the box about these things?'
p409
aS'Can we look for new forms of engagement?'
p410
aS'Canwe think and act in different ways that might advance peace?'
p411
aS'I think, so far, the verdict on theObama administration and on what Mr. Mitchell has been trying to achieve is no.'
p412
aS'And I it isimportant that we look at the Middle East the way it is, not the way we would like it to be orimagine it might be, but what the reality of this increasingly sophisticated Middle East is todaywhat is Hamas really?'
p413
aS'What is bothered really?'
p414
aS"Let's look at these things in a hard headed wayand let's think about and find some new ideas."
p415
aS"And I think right now the president in a half wayhouse and that's why we seeing no movement.John Donvan: I want to let Itamar Rabinovich answer that question but I - after that I get toquestions from the audience, so Id like to disperse our microphones and bring the light up.Itamar your response?Itamar Rabinovich: You know President Obama's--some distancing from Israel."
p416
aS'Abu Mazen,President of the Palestinian authority is not joining the negotiations now.'
p417
aS'Because he saysPresident Obama, you put me up on a tree, you have to help me climb down.'
p418
aS'Because PresidentObama seemed to be taking a pro-Palestinian anti-Israel position at the outset.'
p419
aS'His expectationwas that the Muslim and Arab world will applaud.'
p420
aS'The real reaction was give us more.'
p421
aS'We willnot come to the negotiations, you have to deliver Israel.'
p422
aS'It was a very bad mistake.'
p423
aS"And Rogerwhen you say, think out of the box about the Hamas charter, which is not an anti-Israeli, an anti-Semitic document, speaking about the protocols of Zion, I don't know how to think outside thebox about that, I would rather be in the box.John Donvan: Roger CohenRoger Cohen: So was charter of the PLO."
p424
aS'It got changed and how did it get changed?'
p425
aS'It gotchanged through negotiations.John Donvan: Can you respond to that Itamar?Itamar Rabinovich: Yes.'
p426
aS'You can negotiate with a secular nationalist movement like the Fatah.Hamas is a radical religious fundamentalist organization and you cannot negotiate with peoplewho have these strong religious convictions.John Donvan: Itamar-Rashid Khalidi: Israel is negotiating with them.'
p427
aS'Israel is negotiating with prisoner release withHamas right now.'
p428
aS'Israel negotiates with Hamas all the time.'
p429
aS'In fact it suits Israel perfectly,perfectly to have Hamas and Fatah divided and to have nobody to talk to.'
p430
aS'You will have peace inthis part of the world between Palestinians and Israelis when there is not just a Israeli consensusbut a Palestinian consensus.'
p431
aS'There are enough people in Hamas who are interested in a resolutionof this conflict that if, as Roger said if you think outside the box, we could get something.Itamar Rabinovich: So, when Ehud Olmert went out of his way and offered much more thanEhud Barak and any other Israeli politician, put it on the table, why did Abu Mazen not take it?John Donvan: Let me go to questions from the audience.'
p432
aS'We are going to leave a lot of thingshanging because we will keep going.'
p433
aS'We will come back.'
p434
aS'You can put that question to him, Iwant to move on to this.'
p435
aS"And if one of you wants to take that question back you are welcome tous, write down and see the gentlemen.Unidentified Participant: Thank you.John Donvan: Please stand up and if you're with the media, let's known.Zead Ramadan: My name is Zead Ramadan, I am the President of the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations in New York."
p436
aS'It was often said of Yasser Arafat that he never missed anopportunity to miss an opportunity.'
p437
aS'Is it - have we come into the era where Israel is starting tomake decisions in its worst interest that Charles Freeman, who was a nominee for one of the topintelligence posts in the United States criticized them and said that himself before he pulled hisnomination due to criticism from Israel and American elected officials.'
p438
aS'Are we entering an erawhere Israel continuously make decisions and hurts its future?John Donvan: How would you relate that also to U.S. interest which is our topic tonight?Zead Ramadan: Absolutely.'
p439
aS"We - as an American, I think back as a Palestinian myself, I amjaded whenever they say, whether it's Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or GeorgeBush senior or junior, it's always said that we are going to work towards peace in the MiddleEast, and it always seems like an Israeli Prime Minister is pitching the phrase with the U.S.President and says, 'it doesn't matter what you say."
p440
aS"We're going to do whatever we want to do andwe still going to take your billions from you all the time'."
p441
aS"So as my tax dollars are going to buildsettlements whereJohn Donvan: Yeah, I do need a question, what's your question?Zead Ramadan: I apologize.John Donvan: No, I want a question, that's on a topic.Ziad Ramadan: Is it in the U.S. interest to support Israel financially while they continuouslydisagree with John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat to decide.Stuart Eizenstat: A couple of things, first, several people have mentioned including Rogerinaccurately that the United States continues to provide huge amounts of economic aid to Israel."
p442
aS'Ican tell you that during the first Olmert government, they came to me when I was Undersecretaryof State and they said we are now a highly developed country.'
p443
aS"We don't need, and we don't wantthat economic assistance and they came to us and I negotiated the total cut off of that aid."
p444
aS'There isnot a nickel in economic aid being given to Israel.'
p445
aS"The aid now is all economics.John Donvan: Roger Cohen.Stuart Eizenstat: And the aid is all given for security purposes and not economic purposes, it's allsecurity.Roger Cohen: Congressional report just put the total at $28.9 billion over the past decades sohow you can state there is no economic aid going from United States to Israel."
p446
aS"I don't know."
p447
aS'Inresponse to your questions I - critics of Israel are often told that they are anti Israeli.'
p448
aS'My responseis no, I think in have the long-term interest of Israel in my heart and to say that it is Israelsinterest to go on building these settlements strikes me as the height of foolishness because whatwill be the result of this?'
p449
aS'We are at the point or we are very close to the point where a two statesolution becomes impossible.'
p450
aS'At that point, we are talking about a single state between the riverand the sea.'
p451
aS'That state will very soon - such a state will very soon have more Palestinian Arabs init than Jews.'
p452
aS'What then is going to happen to the Zionist dream?'
p453
aS"And I think to point this out toIsrael, is in fact acting in Israel's self interest, and the unfortunate thing about U.S. policy is itdoesn't - without stepping back it doesn't act strongly enough to stop Israel making a two-statessolution impossible."
p454
aS'And I think that is the very core of the issue here.John Donvan: Gentlemen with eye glasses, sorry?Unidentified Participant: Question for Mr. Cohen and Khalidi.John Donvan: Could you bring the mike a little bit closer?Unidentified Participant: When Stuart Eizenstat said earlier on in the debate that had thePalestinians had a Palestinian version of Gandhi or King it would have been a two states solutiona long time ago.'
p455
aS"Is that a statement with which you agree or disagree, and if you disagree, why?And separately, what is the answer to the question that we lost as we transitioned into the Q&A,why did Abu Mazen turn down the deal?John Donvan: Thank you.Rashid Khalidi: Why don't I answer that question first?"
p456
aS'Abu Mazen does much of what he doesbecause he is weak.'
p457
aS'He is weak because we have made him weak.'
p458
aS'He is weak for other reasons aswell.'
p459
aS'But a primary reason is because Israel and the United States have systematicallyundermined him.'
p460
aS'What happened with the Goldstone report?'
p461
aS"I don't want to go into the Goldstonereport."
p462
aS'Abu Mazen was pressured, was blackmailed, was threatened by the Israelis to, in effectprevent the consideration by United Nations Human Rights body of a report that was critical bothof Hamas and especially of Israel.'
p463
aS'This is an example of the kind of situation that Abu Mazen isin.'
p464
aS'Why is he in this situation?'
p465
aS'He is in the situation because he does not represent all thePalestinians, and he is in that situation because the Palestinian coalition government which wouldhave included have Hamas was something that was strongly opposed both by Israel and theUnited States.'
p466
aS'And that would have been a government in which Hamas would have authorizedAbu Mazen to ahead and negotiate with Israel.That would have been a government that might conceivably have reached an agreement or mightnot have.'
p467
aS'But it certainly would have better than the situation we are in.'
p468
aS'And let just create onepoint about the special relationship.'
p469
aS'One of the things that the special relationship does is itimports Israeli considerations into U.S. law.'
p470
aS"I was told by an American official one of the reasonswe can't have a Palestinian coalition government which might in fact be a better negotiatingpartner is because it's against U.S. law."
p471
aS'We would have to cut-off our funding to any governmentthat included Hamas even a government that authorized negotiations for peace.'
p472
aS"That is anexample of why we should end this special relationship.John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat.Stuart Eizenstat: I want to answer the question and connect an important thread and saysomething I haven't said publicly before because there is a connection."
p473
aS'I sat with Yasser Arafat inhis office in Romala three weeks before Camp David who was suppose to start with PresidentClinton and Prime Minister Barak.'
p474
aS"He said to me, tell President Clinton not to invite me, I'm notready to go and to negotiate."
p475
aS"Likewise the reason why Arafat wouldn't go or didn't want to go andwhy he turned down a remarkable concession from Barak, 95% of the territory, East Jerusalem isthe capital is the same reason that Abu Mazen wouldn't accept and even more generous offerfrom all Olmert and that is they are afraid they will be assassinated by Hamas."
p476
aS"That's point blankthe reason."
p477
aS"And the radicals in the Palestinian movement who I do not believer in a majority havea tremendous hammer-hold over the moderate.John Donvan: Let's go to another question."
p478
aS'Gentleman, yes, yellow tie.'
p479
aS'You can stand and - Iowe you a comeback.Unidentified Participant: My question is very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. securityJohn Donvan: Can you bring your microphone up a little bit?Unidentified Participant: Sorry.'
p480
aS"Very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. security, youtalked a lot about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and how the special relationships affect, thespecial relationship affect the peace process, but very specifically how would change in thisrelationship affect U.S. security interest specifically vis--vis the jihadi elements who are workingagainst the U.S.. How would that relationship either improve their view of the U.S. or be adetriment to the U.S.?John Donvan: I was just talking about the impact on our allies, you are asking about the impacton our relationship with our foes, which side would like to take that.Roger Cohen: Well, I think if you can advance a Middle East peace clearly you are going towithdraw, remove, a very powerful recruitment tool - for the jihadis.If you look at Osama Bin Laden's speeches going back a very long way."
p481
aS"If you look in the 9/11report it what Khalid Sheikh Mohammad said, the mastermind of 9/11 about how policy towardthe Palestinians was really what drove him toward the - It wasn't his stay in the United States."
p482
aS'Itwas what he observed of U.S. Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.'
p483
aS'So, if you can appear moreas an honest broker, if you can move this paralyzed process in some way, then I think you couldadvance U.S. security in that respect.'
p484
aS'Look have the Palestinians made mistakes, have there beenoffice on the table that should perhaps have been accepted, yes.'
p485
aS"But we're not talking about thepast."
p486
aS"We're talking about trying to move forward here, that is what this debate is about tonight,and I think to throw out the Olmert offer when he was already had great legal difficulties, was onhis way out of office, it really wasn't credible at that point."
p487
aS"So I don't find that in any waypersuasive.John Donvan: Itamar RabinovichItamar Rabinovich: Two issues, one, terrorism, that support for Israel increases terrorism, andyou all know New Yorkers, you live in New York, open the magazine last week, very interestingstory about a young man from Alabama, Omar Hammami, who grew up in a small town inAlabama, and he is now fighting with Al Qaeda in Somalia.Very interesting long article in the New York Times magazine."
p488
aS"The word Israel doesn't appearonce."
p489
aS'He became a terrorist not because of Israel but because of other reasons.'
p490
aS'Secondly, I wantto go back to the point raised by Stuart Eizenstat before.'
p491
aS'Gandhi, other leaders.'
p492
aS'Abu Mazen is notweak because the United States or Israel weakened him.'
p493
aS'He is weak because he is weak.'
p494
aS'Whereyou have - even people who made peace, Gandhi was not made by the British, Mandela was notmade by the Americans and King Hussein and Anwar El Sadat who signed peace with Israel werestrong leaders.'
p495
aS"That's why they could take their countries to peace."
p496
aS'But unfortunately, we havenot had the kind of Palestinian leader who would become, who could become the PalestinianMandela, who would bring about the rapprochement, the reconciliation between Israelis andPalestinians.This comes from an Israeli who wants that.Rashid Khalidi: Let me say something.'
p497
aS'Let me say something.'
p498
aS'Let me say something about thissainted Nelson Mandela, a man who I think, we all greatly respect.'
p499
aS'He headed an armedmovement.'
p500
aS'He was not an apostle of non-violence.'
p501
aS'He led an armed movement that succeeded inforcing a political resolution of a conflict.'
p502
aS"Now, I personally am a believer in this conflict, now,that non-violent means are the best means for the Palestinians.I don't think, however, that we should get too mystical about this."
p503
aS'There are many colonial, manyoppressive, many occupation regimes that would never ever disappeared but for armed violentresistance.'
p504
aS"That is something that - that is something that's very painful to say because in thiscountry, we have a constitution, and what Martin Luther King was calling for was that we live upto the highest principles of this country."
p505
aS'I argue that in the Palestinian case, that would beappropriate, although for other reasons.'
p506
aS'But to say in a situation of occupation, and in a situationof oppression, this is not two equal parties.'
p507
aS'These are not two states.'
p508
aS'There is one countrybetween the Mediterranean and the sea.'
p509
aS'It occupies the entirety of the territory.'
p510
aS"It's the onlysovereign state."
p511
aS'It has ruled every single Palestinian in that territory, some of them as citizens ofthe State of Israel, a minority, four million of them as helots with no rights for 43 years,resistance in that case is legitimate.John Donvan: Go back to the audience.Unidentified Participant: Good evening.'
p512
aS"Is it anti-semitism of United Nations which Israel andAmerica always complains about that their 50 and odd resolutions requesting Israel to vacate theoccupied land, Israel and America look the other way, but whereas when it comes to Iraq war,Bush Presidency on one resolution went for an illegal war.This special arrangement between Israel and America is really hurting, in my opinion, and myquestion to one of the panelists will be, why are these resolutions not implemented, which areasking Israel to vacate the occupied land?John Donvan: You're asking if U.S. has a double standard on UN resolution?Unidentified Participant: U.S. has a double standard, Israel has a double standard.John Donvan: Thank you.Roger Cohen: The United States has vetoed.John Donvan: Roger, I want to bring this to the insider first and then I'll come to you, okay?Stuart Eizenstat.Stuart Eizenstat: The UN Human Rights Commission has developed resolutions over the lastdecade and a half, two-thirds of which are directed at Israel, not in Iran, not in Iraq, not at all thehuman rights violations that occur around the world."
p513
aS'Two-thirds are directed to Israel.'
p514
aS'This isgrossly disproportionate.'
p515
aS"Number two, with respect to general resolutions, let's go back to the firstresolution of the United Nations, which was to create a two state solution."
p516
aS"And Ben Gurionaccepted a sliver of territory and it was rejected by the Arabs and that rejection has continuedwith the exception of Egypt and Jordan from 1947 to 2010.John Donvan: Roger Cohen?Roger Cohen: United States has vetoed more than 40 resolutions critical of Israel of recent years.That's more I believe than all the vetoes put together of all the other members of the SecurityCouncil."
p517
aS'This is indeed a special relationship.'
p518
aS"And the question we're asking tonight is, is thatreally in the benefit of the United States and Israel?"
p519
aS'And I would submit not.'
p520
aS'If you look at theGoldstone report, the UN report on the war in Gaza, surely this report was imperfect.'
p521
aS'No doubtthere were errors in it.'
p522
aS'I know Judge Goldstone.'
p523
aS'I met him years ago and the Hague, believe me,he is balanced and intelligent man.'
p524
aS"Did he make some mistakes, yes, but the Israeli reaction was,no this is just an expression of the world's bias, this is an outrage."
p525
aS'This is absolutely unacceptable.And the U.S. gave it some protection in that stance, which I consider to have been outrageous.There is no justification for the position what is happened since.'
p526
aS'Israel has quietly censured twogenerals.'
p527
aS'It has agreed to pay compensation to the United Nations.'
p528
aS"Behind the defiance, it hasbeen making its own admissions of the fact that they were problems in this, and I think it is theUnited States' special relationship with Israel which allows it to say before the world, no, wenever make mistakes, this is all a plot against us, and I don't think this is helpful to Israel."
p529
aS'And itis not good for the United States to be in that position.John Donvan: Itamar Rabinovich?Itamar Rabinovich: The United Nations, the Human Rights Commission, do you know who arethe members of that commission?'
p530
aS'Who was the Chairman of that commission, the country calledLibya.'
p531
aS'Who is a member of that commission?'
p532
aS'Zimbabwe with Mugabe.Roger, you are from originally, you know South Africa and you know who Mugabe is.'
p533
aS'So if thecommission has Libya and Zimbabwe and countries like that, it has no moral authority andGoldstone drew his mandate from a place without moral authority.'
p534
aS'John Donvan: Rashid Khalidi.Rashid Khalidi: Yes.'
p535
aS'As someone whose father works for the United Nations, I am going todefend this institution.I think it ill - it does not behoove those who are friends of Israel to bash United Nations.'
p536
aS'Thecertificate of Israel is delivered by the United Nations in the form of the resolution thatAmbassador Eizenstat mentioned, the partition resolution of 1947.'
p537
aS'Now that did not give the issuea sliver of Palestine.'
p538
aS'It gave 33% of the population that owned 6% of the land, 55% of thecountry; some sliver.'
p539
aS'Let me say a couple of other things.I cannot let some of these things pass simply as a historian.'
p540
aS'We are told that the Arab countrieshave been rejecting everything since 2010.'
p541
aS'The majority of Arab countries came to the MadridPeace Conference.'
p542
aS'Ambassador Rabinovich and I saw them there.'
p543
aS'Now what kind of rejection isit when they come to a peace conference.'
p544
aS'They all voted in favor of an Arab peace resolution inBeirut and one before that, way back in 2002.'
p545
aS'This is not rejection.'
p546
aS'We were told aboutremarkable concessions.Remember, when a country is in illegal occupation of territory and it agrees to give it back, thereare various ways of talking about that.'
p547
aS'I would not use the word concession.'
p548
aS'ThirdlyJohn Donvan: Rashid, I just want to ask you, how long is your list?Rashid Khalidi: Pardon me?John Donvan: How long is your list?Rashid Khalidi: I have two more, but I will go for one.John Donvan: Thank you.Rashid Khalidi: Okay.'
p549
aS'We were told that in 1967, Israel was almost eliminated.'
p550
aS'If you go to theU.S.'
p551
aS'government documents and you go to the extraordinarily ample Israeli documentation, youwill see that not one Israeli military intelligence or American military intelligence report ormilitary officer of field rank and above thought that there was any chance of Israel being defeatedlet alone eliminated in the 1967 war.'
p552
aS'I know people here believe that was a possibility, I knowthat many people in Israel feared it, but that was not a possibility at that time.'
p553
aS'I could go on andon.John Donvan: Okay, all right, I want to go back to a question here.'
p554
aS'I need to do a little bit ofannouncing for radio.'
p555
aS'I just want to remind everybody, we are in a question and answer section ofthis Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p556
aS"I'm John Donvan of ABC News acting as moderator."
p557
aS'Wehave four debaters.'
p558
aS'Two teams of two debating this motion, the U.S. should step back from itsspecial relationship with Israel.'
p559
aS'The gentlemen standing now with grey suit, red tie?John Girkoff: Thank you.'
p560
aS'My Name is John Girkoff.'
p561
aS'Among other things, I am affiliated withTel Aviv University.'
p562
aS"A question I have is - small statement, but then a question is all the attentiontonight has been against Israel or for Israel or against the United States or for the United States,but the Palestinians have to start taking some responsibility for what's going on?"
p563
aS'And the questionI have is, what have they done over the last 40 years to instill the confidence in the United States,to maybe ease up on the relationship or become more, as you say, evenhanded and what can - doyou think they should be doing or can be doing to instill the confidence that you two have that theUnited States should end that relationship?John Donvan: Thank you for the question.'
p564
aS"Good question.Rashid Khalidi: It's a very good question."
p565
aS"As someone who wrote a book recently about just thisissue in Palestinian history about the responsibility of the Palestinians have to consider for thingsthat have happened in Palestinian history not just in the last couple of decades, but going back tothe 20s and 30s, I think it's a question that should be asked by Palestinians and to Palestinians,and I take the point."
p566
aS'What can Palestinians do?'
p567
aS'Firstly, they have to get their act together.'
p568
aS"It'sabsolutely essentially that there be a Palestinian consensus on how to get out of the mess that theyare in, and that's up to the Palestinians themselves."
p569
aS"Nobody else can do that for them and that'sthe first thing."
p570
aS"We are taking about Israel because that's the proposition before the house.You voted on something about the United States and Israeli special relationship, but I think it's agood question anyway because this is a key element of this problem."
p571
aS'The Palestinians, I have tosay, have not just been systematic divided by outside forces.'
p572
aS'They have failed to unifythemselves.'
p573
aS'The Palestinians have not just failed to generate some of the leadership that I thinkthey deserve.'
p574
aS'I have been very critical of Palestinian leadership in the past.'
p575
aS'It is however the casethat their leadership has been systematically subject to assassination, not just by Israel, also byArab governments, and they have problems not only with Israel, they have severe problems withall of the Arab governments with which they have to deal.'
p576
aS"Governments which by and large arenot democratic, governments which by and large do not represent their own people, and that'sanother problem that we're not discussing here, but which I think is well worth discussing.John Donvan: I just want to ask, are there no women with questions?"
p577
aS'Thank you.'
p578
aS"I didn't see youbefore."
p579
aS"Right in the center, we're going to do three women in a row here now."
p580
aS"Right in the center,do you have a microphone?Okay, I'll come back, I will come to you.Rema Azazi: Thank you.John Donvan: Can you bring the mike a little bit closer?Rema Azazi: Thank you, can you hear me?John Donvan: It's not on yet, try one more time."
p581
aS"It's not your fault.Rema Azazi: Hi, can you hear me?John Donvan: Yes.Rema Azazi: Okay."
p582
aS"My name is Rema Azazi (ph), I'm Masters in Near-Eastern Studies at NYU.The idea of morality has been mentioned by both sides."
p583
aS"It's been mostly invoked by Mr. Eizenstatsaying that we can't end this special relationship because it would be undermining the morality,that is what the special relationship is."
p584
aS'And I would like to ask you, Mr. Eizenstat, why theprinciple of morality is not being applied to the case of the Palestinians?'
p585
aS'So, when you discussthat justice and fairness is important, what would justice and fairness look like in the West Bankand Gaza?'
p586
aS'What can Israel do for justice and fairness to exist there?'
p587
aS'And can you also speakabout justice and fairness for Palestinians who live in Israel and have Israeli citizenship?'
p588
aS"I'mspecifically thinking of theJohn Donvan: Are you asking what Israel can do or what the U.S. can do, because I would like tostay more towardsRema Azazi: U.S. and Israel?John Donvan: Okay, thank you."
p589
aS'Fair enough.'
p590
aS"Stuart Eizenstat.Stuart Eizenstat: I think it's very good question and it is a moral imperative of the United States,not only to support Israel's independence and security, but also to see to it that the Palestinianshave a decent standard of living and a state of their own."
p591
aS'It is the United States of America that isthe major economic supplier of aid to the Palestinians, okay?'
p592
aS'Not France, not Germany, not theUK, not Russia, it is the United States.'
p593
aS'Number two, right now as we speak, General Dayton, athree-star-general is in the process of training over 20,000 Palestinian police who are in placeslike Jenin now able to take over security and allowing the Israeli defense forces to withdrawallowing checkpoints to be reduced.'
p594
aS'I met in Davos ten days ago, Prime Minister Fayyad, he is agreat man.'
p595
aS'He is a great man, he building a state from the bottom up.'
p596
aS'He told me, Stu, we aregoing to have 10% real growth in the territories in the West Bank, and the reason is because thePalestinians are now under U.S. leadership, beginning to take on their own security, rooting outHamas and giving the Israeli defense forces the confidence to withdraw.'
p597
aS'So the United States issupporting economically, militarily, in every other way the effort of the Palestinians to developtheir state.'
p598
aS'And George Mitchell, who negotiated after many, many hard years, the Good Fridayagreement on Northern Ireland is a superb negotiator.'
p599
aS"He is there every month negotiating as anhonest broker with a notion that we have a responsibility to the Palestinians as well as to theIsraelis.John Donvan: I want to come back to you because I saw how intently you were listening to.What did you think of that answer?Rema Azazi: (inaudible).John Donvan: Yes, we will bring a mike, let's just get a mike come back to you, but I don't wantto go on terribly long."
p600
aS"I just want to know if it went to the point that you were asking about?Rema Azazi: I would like to, is it on?, compare the aid that you just spoke up with the millions orbillions of dollars that go towards Israel in terms of military aid, if not other aid as well.John Donvan: Okay.Stuart Eizenstat: The aid to the Palestinians only started fairly recently because it is only afterMadrid that the PLO abandoned their charter to destroy Israel, Hamas is yet to do it and indicateda willingness to have a two state solution although they we haven't fulfilled it."
p601
aS"So the economicaid hasn't accumulated but it is very substantial."
p602
aS"On a per capita basis, very substantial, and it's allgoing for economic assistance.John Donvan: There was a, yes."
p603
aS'Maam, I see you in the far corner and you have a yellow pad inyour hand, and if you wave it, a microphone will come to you.Sarah Lehman: My name is Sarah Lehman (ph) and I write for the Jewish press, and I have astatement and a question directed mostly towards Roger Cohen.John Donvan: Can you do more question than statement?Sarah Lehman: Yes, okay.'
p604
aS"In light of the fact that Israeli concessions over the years have not ledto peace because the Palestinians have responded mostly with violence and also in light of thefact that Hamas charter has not changed its call for the destruction of the Jewish state, and theincitement that continues to go on - anti-Semitic incitement and propaganda by the Palestiniansunder the supposed moderateJohn Donvan: I need to come home with this question, I see where you are going.Sarah Lehman: Personally as a Jew, how would you - why would advocate a severing of thespecial relationship with America in favor of towards Arabs or Palestinians who wish for yourdemise?John Donvan: That's a question for Roger Cohen?Sarah Lehman: Anyone.Roger Cohen: I think I have tried to describe why - certainly, there have been Israeli attempts,very serious Israeli attempts to make peace."
p605
aS'But if you look at the last 20 years, peace is going toinvolve an exchange of land, and what has Israel continued to do over the last 20 years?'
p606
aS'It hasdoubled, tripled the size of the settlements in the West Bank and this simply makes it impossibleto make that exchange.'
p607
aS"Look, what we just heard about what's happening in the West Bank showsthat there is nothing congenital about a Palestinian inability to take responsibility for their livesand for their governance."
p608
aS'Given half the chance, I think they are capable of it.'
p609
aS'But when, if you,have you driven through the West Bank recently, madam?Sarah Lehman: Yes.Roger Cohen: What did you see?'
p610
aS'I think you saw a fractured, divided Palestinian community.Israeli garrisons on every hill, road blocks, the difficulty of families to get to the market, to getthe fields, to get to their jobs and so on.'
p611
aS'What does this say to Palestinians about the seriousnessof Israeli intent to make peace?'
p612
aS'It says these guys are not serious, and why has it that the PrimeMinister Fayyad has not come back to the table.'
p613
aS'He has not come back to the table because thePalestinians are not satisfied of the essential seriousness of Israel.'
p614
aS'And what is enabling thegovernment or Prime Minister Netanyahu to take this stance, it is the unconditional nature of U.S.support under the special relationship, which is why ladies and gentlemen you should vote for theproposition tonight.John Donvan: We are coming down towards the end of the question section, so I just want to askthe panelist at this point to be slightly more concise.'
p615
aS'We are doing a few more questions.'
p616
aS"ItamarRabinovich.Itamar Rabinovich: Commenting on Roger Cohen's last comment, I think in an earlier comment,you actually provided the answers to why the Palestinians will not negotiate."
p617
aS'Because you painteda scenario that over the next 10, 20 years, if the status quo continues, there will be one countrywith a Palestinian majority.'
p618
aS'This stretch has not been lost on many Palestinians, and support forthe two state solution has dwindled among the Palestinians because many of them say, lets sitback and wait and it will be all ours.'
p619
aS'Because it will be one man, one vote with a Palestinianmajority, and that is a very serious danger.'
p620
aS"That's why there are also commonalties - evencommonalities between Rashid Khalidi and I because -Roger Cohen: It's a matter of danger exist, why is Israel not being more serious about a two statesolution, which is the only way to avoid a one state outcome.Itamar Rabinovich: Because the answer is - because the party I voted for lost the last election.Roger Cohen: Well, there you go."
p621
aS'Thank you.John Donvan: Rashid.Rashid Khalidi: Palestinians negotiate.'
p622
aS"I'm a Palestinian American."
p623
aS'I spent three yearsnegotiating, you were dealing with the Syrians, I was dealing with -Itamar Rabinovich: With Israelis.Rashid Khalidi,: Yes.'
p624
aS'With Yaken Rubenstein (ph) specifically.'
p625
aS'And what we were facing thenwas an American commitment under the first Bush administration to do something if things weredone, that prejudged or in some way prefigured an outcome and we came to them.'
p626
aS'And we said,wait a minute, Israelis are closing off Jerusalem, the close of Jerusalem was just starting in thisperiod and settlement is continuing.'
p627
aS'They are eating the pie we are supposed to be negotiating andwe got no response from the United States.This was in 1991, went for years and years and years, Palestinians were negotiating.'
p628
aS'Palestiniansnegotiated with Israel without any problem for that entire decade and got absolutely nowhere.Now you can say the Oslo Accords, the Oslo Accords immiserated the Palestinians.'
p629
aS'PalestinianGDP decreased over that decade from 1990 to 2000.'
p630
aS"The Palestinians who were able to moveanywhere in the occupied territories into Israel to the Golan Heights in 1990 or '91, '92 werelocked into whatever you want to call them, Bantustans, ghettos whatever you want to call themby the end of that period of the Oslo Accord."
p631
aS'So this process of settlement is not something whichis just a minor issue.'
p632
aS'It is a central issue, it is absolutely central if you expect the Palestiniannegotiate, this is something that should have been stopped 20 years ago, not 2010.Stuart Eizenstat: Professor, you are historian.'
p633
aS'I was in charge of the economic dimension of thepeace process.'
p634
aS'I can tell you your figures are totally incorrect.'
p635
aS'Between 1997 and 2000, theterritories grew at an average of 5%, unemployment was down to 8% in the West Bank and 14%in Gaza.'
p636
aS'A 100,000 Palestinians were coming into Israel every single day to work.'
p637
aS'It was 40% ofthe GDP of the territories remittances.'
p638
aS'20,000 Arab Palestinian business people could drive inwithout any checkpoints.'
p639
aS'Yes, 1997 and then what happened?'
p640
aS"Yasser Arafat in 2000 brought thewhole house of cards down on the process, refusing the offer and instigating the second intifada.So it's very important to understand case and effect here."
p641
aS'We were on a real process of peace, Ipersonally went to Gaza.'
p642
aS'I saw the Gaza industrial estate with 30 companies from all over theworld creating 1200 jobs in Gaza, a second phase started.'
p643
aS'We had Israelis visiting Romolo (ph)over the weekend.'
p644
aS'We had 100,000 Palestinians coming into Israel every day to work.John Donvan: Stuart, we see where you are going, but I just have a little bit more time left,woman on the balcony and just give a minute for the camera to find you.Danielle Abraham: My name is Danielle Abraham (ph), I am at Argos - student at the Argosprogram of leadership and diplomacy that Herzliya in Israel.'
p645
aS'We just arrived two days ago.'
p646
aS'Myquestion is about U.S. public opinion.'
p647
aS'Because as we saw on the last Presidential debate as in allpresidential debates, the one thing that both can take always (inaudible) is the special relationshipwith Israel and this is not the coincidence.'
p648
aS'This is because the all studies and all polls show thatthe United States public supports this special relationship.'
p649
aS"Now, -John Donvan: So what's your question?Danielle Abraham: So my question is of course to Mr. Cohen and professor Khalidi should - isn'tit a shame that this the public support of the people, isn't it a shame to American democracy thatthis is not factored in to this debate?John Donvan: Well, Roger Cohen?Roger Cohen: Thank you for that question."
p650
aS'It makes any adjustment in U.S. policy toward Israelsuch as President Obama is now trying to accomplish extremely difficult.'

aS'There is a statecalled Florida.'
p652
aS"It's a vital state in the U.S. presidential election."
p653
aS'It has a large Jewish community.This calculation is not lost on Americas leadership.'
p654
aS'President Obama, I understand, has been toldby some Jewish congressman, if you want your health bill, step back on Israel.'
p655
aS'So the reality isindeed that it is very hard I have heard that reliably.'
p656
aS'Thereality of the situation is that it is extremely difficult to steer a U.S. public opinion in any waytoward any acceptance of an adjustment of policy towards the State of Israel.'
p657
aS'I think it should bedone in the following terms: The President should explain that the adjustments he is making arein pursuit of peace and in pursuit of the long-term peace and security of the State of Israel.Policies up to now have failed.'
p658
aS'Therefore, we should see a change.John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat?Stuart Eizenstat: I was wondering how long it would take and who would raise the issue ofquote unquote, "Untoward Jewish influence over U.S. formed policies.'
p659
aS'" I am glad you finally(inaudible) came to it.Roger Cohen: I didnt say untoward.Stuart Eizenstat: Now let me just say I have served in three administrations.'
p660
aS"I didn't say all -this is a dangerous canard that 2% of the U.S. population has somehow got its hand around theneck of American foreign policy."
p661
aS"American foreign policy towards Israel is supported by abipartisan majority because the American public recognizes that Israel and the United Statesshare common interest and common values.And those are always counter balanced by oil interest, by corporate interest that have majordefense interest, major business interest, that's the way policies is made in the United States, isjust a clash of interest."
p662
aS"But the notion that 2% of the U.S. population is driving a policy againstwhere the public thinks simply belied by every survey that's been made.Roger Cohen: Nobody said that.John Donvan: Itamar RabinovichItamar Rabinovich: Maybe you should elect a President from Alaska where there are no Jews.Rashid Khalidi: You would like that.John Donvan: There is a gentleman with the blazer and sweater."
p663
aS'This may be our last question.Unidentified Participant: My name is Allen Skolnick (ph).'
p664
aS'Israel as many of you know has 1.2million Arabs living in Israel they are probably more mosque in Israel than or certainly than theyare maybe close to synagogues in Europe.'
p665
aS'With that background in mind the presumption that wehear all during the discussion of course this debate is that Palestinian state if it was to be wouldhave to be essentially without any Jews.'
p666
aS'The whole discussion is the settlements is the biggestimpediment to peace, alter something out of the box, Roger Cohen, what is the Palestinianposition which I think might in gender more, a better U.S. special relationship?'
p667
aS"Why isn't built ona basis of inclusion even at the scant change of minority of Jews and establish itself on enforcingminority rights for some even for Jews and demonstrate its small character and its commitment topeace instead of having to give a constant reiteration of a new Arab country that will be one morewithout any Jews.John Donvan: Roger Cohen.Roger Cohen: Thank you sir."
p668
aS"I'm not sure there are many Israelis who would want to go and livein the West Bank."
p669
aS'Certainly, under the current conditions there are some who live there, I am notgoing to argue with this, that Israel is by far the most liberal and democratic state in the region.'
p670
aS'Ithas a free press, it has a relatively independent judiciary, it has democratic system, it hasremarkable achievements in technology and its economy.'
p671
aS"It has everything except peace, andwhat we are talking about tonight is how the best to stay here this remarkable society towardwhether it's requesting for and I don't think it's through the policy that Israel is currently pursuingor through the current banking that United States is giving for those polices that is what we aredebating."
p672
aS'Would a Palestinian state is ever comes into being should it offer ecology ofopportunity for citizens of all race, religion, background, et cetera, yes, it should.John Donvan: And that concludes around two of our debates.'
p673
aS'And here is where we are about tohear brief closing statements from each of the debaters in turn.'
p674
aS"Those statements will be twominutes each and it's their last chance to change your mind and from the live audience beforehandwe knew where you stood before the debate actually begin on our motion the U.S. should stepback from its special relationship with Israel."
p675
aS'We asked you to vote before the debate where youstood and at that point 33% of you were for the motion and 42% were against and 25% remainedundecided, you will be asked to vote once again and pick the winner in just a few minutes fromnow.'
p676
aS'But first we are going onto round three closing statements and speaking first against themotion.'
p677
aS'The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p678
aS'Stuart Eizenstatformer ambassador to the European Union under Bill Clinton and Chief Domestic Policy Advisorto Jimmy Carter.Stuart Eizenstat: Number one, Israel is not a recruitment tool for terrorism as Roger said, it isabsolutely not.'
p679
aS'They recruit on the basis of hatred toward the west and towards secular pro-western Arab states.'
p680
aS'Number two, Israel has shown when there is a peace partner Satad Egypt.King Hussein and George that they will negotiate that they will make concessions and peace willcome when the Palestinian leadership demonstrates a commitment like Arafat, like Hussein didand like Sadat did.'
p681
aS"Third, let's talk about concrete benefits.Israel does not just act on its own interest."
p682
aS'If for example in the first Gulf War 1991 agreed withPresident George H.W.'
p683
aS"Bush not to retaliate against the barrage of Saddam Hussein's scudmissiles on Tel Aviv, staying in shelters so that President Bush could keep his coalition togetherin the first Gulf of war."
p684
aS'Second, Israel gets concrete benefits by supporting the U.S. in terms ofanti nuclear proliferation in the region destroying the nuclear reactor of Saddam Hussein in Iraqin 1981, and more recently Syrias budding nuclear facility supported by North Korea andstanding shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. on the Iranian nuclear arms ambitions, and allowingthe U.S. to take the lead on sanctions.'
p685
aS'Israel shares real time intelligence.'
p686
aS'I have seen it with theU.S.'
p687
aS'on terrorism and to the U.S. not simply at itself on rends nuclear capabilities.'
p688
aS'GeneralKeegan, the Former Head of Air Force Intelligence said, "I could not have obtained the sameintelligence I receive from Israel if there were five CIAs.'
p689
aS'Israel alsoJohn Donvan: Stuart, your time is up, but I will give you one more sentence to summarize.Stuart Eizenstat: Thank you.'
p690
aS"In terms of the economy itself which we haven't talked about."
p691
aS'Israelserves as the location for every major American high-tech company developing cell phones andchips to keep America safe with passports - providing aerial vehicles to help our borders.John Donvan: Thank you, Stuart Eizenstat.'
p692
aS'Summarizing for the motion, the U.S. should stepback from its special relationship with Israel.'
p693
aS'Roger Cohen, a columnist and former foreigncorrespondent and foreign editor for the New York Times.Roger Cohen: Ladies and gentlemen, if you strip away all the rhetoric of the opposing team.'
p694
aS'Inthe end, what are they are arguing for?'
p695
aS'They are arguing for more of the same.'
p696
aS'If you think moreof the same is fine, if you think the growing hatreds, antagonism, estrangement in the area is justfine, then you should vote against the resolution and not for it, as we are arguing.'
p697
aS"I don't believethat's the case, I believe what's going on is unhealthy and the United States by stepping backwould put pressure on Israel to adjust its policies and open new avenues to the new Middle Eastof which President Obama has spoken."
p698
aS'In the end, you have to put your backbone where yourwish bone is, and what does America wish for?'
p699
aS'Two states, Israel and Palestine living side byside in peace and security.'
p700
aS'And as we have described, uncritical U.S. support of Israel in policiesthat undermine the possibility of two states is just a recipe for further failure.'
p701
aS'What does Americaalso wish for under President Obama?'
p702
aS'He wants a new relationship with the Islamic world.'
p703
aS'Thiswill require more than just words and pretty speeches.'
p704
aS'It will require a new balance in the U.S.approach to the region a new readiness to speak to enemies, only then will we move forward.'
p705
aS'Andif you think as Stu Eizenstat just suggested that if the United States succeeded in establishing anew and more harmonious relationship with the Islamic world this would have no effectwhatsoever on the terrorist threat that the United States faces.'
p706
aS'Believe me, I think you are wrong.I would like to conclude with the words of Mahmoud Darwish, the great Palestinian poet whodied last year and he wrote in his poem State of Siege, me or him that how war starts but it endsin awkward stances, me and him.'
p707
aS"It's time for American policy to reflect better the him and theme of the Middle East."
p708
aS'For all sorts of reasons this will not be easy, which is why ladies andgentlemen, you would help in this difficult adjustment by being courageous and voting for theproposition tonight.John Donvan: Thank you Roger Cohen.'
p709
aS"On a little bit of a course of these two statements turninginto 2 minutes and 24 seconds, so I'm going to give that to everybody.Our motion is U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel and summarizing hisposition against the motion."
p710
aS'Itamar Rabinovich, former Israeli Ambassador to the United Statesand chief negotiator with Syria in the mid-1990s.Itamar Rabinovich: I want to look at the vision, the dream.'
p711
aS"The President of United States on AirForce One, landing at an airport in Gaza wouldn't that be a great moment."
p712
aS'It already happened,Bill Clinton landed with Air Force One at an Air Force in Gaza in the late 1990s.'
p713
aS'There was anefforts by our opponent to describe a unilinear Israeli undermining of any effort to make peacebetween Israel and Palestinians to detriment of the region of the United States.'
p714
aS'But actuallyduring the last 20 years and 30 years almost 40 years of the peace process that began in 1973what kept the peace process going, it was American Israeli cooporation.'
p715
aS'There were some veryhigh moments in this, the peace with Egypt, peace with Jordan.'
p716
aS"First Israeli visit to countries inthe Gulf and in the North Africa and yes, Clinton landing in the Gaza strip, at an airport when itseemed that the Palestinian are underway to state of an independence before everything turnedsour because of the change of mind of Yasser Arafat's conduct that led to the disastrousconsequences of the last decade 2000 to 2010."
p717
aS'Second, I think we had a problem, our debate wasdiverted tonight from debate on the U.S. Israeli special relationship to a debate on the Palestineproblem, a very worthy subject, but not exactly that the focus of the issue.'
p718
aS'The issue is here is theMiddle East a crucial part of the world, here is an Arab world 330 million people almost half abillion in decade or two.'
p719
aS'This is not all subjected to the Palestinian issue.'
p720
aS'There are many otherissues.'
p721
aS'Iran was barely mentioned tonight.'
p722
aS'Now I tell you, you go to somebody who lives inKuwait, or somebody who lives in Cairo, or somebody who lives in Oman and asking what isuppermost in your mind.'
p723
aS'And he would say, Iran.'
p724
aS'The Iranian threat, the Iranian bomb, theIranian expansionism.And what do you expect.'
p725
aS'I expect the United States to protect me from Iran.John Donvan: Thank you.Itamar Rabinovich: Iran, the United States can do thatJohn Donvan: Thank you.'
p726
aS'Our motion is the U.S. should step back from its special relationshipwith Israel.'
p727
aS'Our final speaker to summaries his position for the motion Rashid Khalidi professorat Columbia University and former advisor to the Palestinian delegation for Arab Israeli peacenegotiations.Rashid Khalidi: Thank you.'
p728
aS'You should vote for this proposition because it would end our recordof failure in Palestinian Israeli peace making.'
p729
aS'And counter to the views of what you just heardthis is centrally important in the Middle East.'
p730
aS'You should vote for this proposition because itwould stop the United States for enabling Israel in its worst habits of occupation and settlement,things that harm United States harm of course Palestinians but also harm Israel.'
p731
aS'Most importantly,you should vote for the proposition because it would help to bring peace and would be in the U.S.national interest.'
p732
aS"I've said that if you do not vote for this proposition you are voting for the statusquo."
p733
aS'More process no peace.'
p734
aS'Now that is not the status quo that is stable, that is a status quo it isevolving, I would suggest in a fashion not favorable to I think most of the interests that most of usshare.'
p735
aS'Let me read quote briefly, as long as in this territory west of the Jordon there is only onepolitical entity called Israel.'
p736
aS'It is going to be either non Jewish or non democratic.'
p737
aS'Speakercontinued if this block of millions of Palestinians cannot vote this will become an apartheid state.This was not some anti-Semitism; this is not some Israel passer; this is Defense Minister of Stateof Israel, Ehud Barak speaking on the 3rd of February at Herzliya.'
p738
aS'That is status quo that is whereit is going.'
p739
aS'It is in - ultimately a decision for the Israelis to take where they want to go, but weenable this, that is why you should vote for this proposition.'
p740
aS'And let me conclude by sayingsomething about Iran.'
p741
aS'If Israel attacks Iran, in a situation where this special relation isunmodified, imagine if you will the impact on U.S. interests, on U.S. troops in Iraq, on the U.S.position in the Gulf and the Gulf itself.'
p742
aS'Now if this relationship remains unchanged, if UnitedStates is perceived as the hand maiden, the guardian, the enabler, of everything that Israel doeswe will be responsible when and if that catastrophic things happens.'
p743
aS'If Iran is a problem for theregion not just for Israel, but it is not a problem to be resolved in the way that a lot of Israelis arepushing us to resolve it.'
p744
aS'That is why among many other reasons you should vote for theproposition.John Donvan: Thank you Rashid Khalidi.'
p745
aS"And that concludes our closing statements and nowit's time to learn which side you feel argued best, we are going to ask you again to go to thekeypads at your seat."
p746
aS'Our motion is that U.S. should step back from its special relationship withIsrael if you agree with the motion now, push number 1, if you disagree, push number 2.'
p747
aS'If youremain undecided, push number 3.'
p748
aS'Or if you became undecided push number 3.'
p749
aS'And if you - ifsomebody is having some trouble, if you push the wrong button just push it, the one you want tocorrect with and it will lock it.'
p750
aS'All right, so we are very close to getting the results which I thinkwe are locking out and are being tabulated at the moment.'
p751
aS'So, before I get to those, first of all Iwant to thank our panelist for coming here in the spirit of listening as well as debating.'
p752
aS"I alsowant to thank the people in the audience who asked questions because there wasn't a clunkeramong them."

(lp774
S"John Donvan: I'd like to welcome Robert Rosenkranz, CEO of Intelligence Squared U.S.. Robert Rosenkranz: Well thank you so much for joining us tonight."
p775
aS'When these debates started four years ago, our first resolution was, "We must tolerate a nuclear Iran.'
p776
aS'" Well this could well be the year that Iran gets the bomb.'
p777
aS"And our government's actions suggest that it is voting for the motion."
p778
aS'Israel on the other hand, might quite rationally decide it cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran and take military action to prevent it.'
p779
aS'This is the perhaps the most dramatic and consequential way U.S. and Israeli policy may diverge.'
p780
aS'But there are many others.'
p781
aS"Israel's priority is its own security, full stop."
p782
aS'The U.S. is committed to Israeli security, but it has many conflicting priorities, keeping control of Middle East oil out of the hands of Jihadi extremists for one, encouraging the recycling of petro dollars into our vulnerable economy, strengthening ties with moderate Arab regimes, avoiding nuclear proliferation in the region.'
p783
aS"U.S. objectives might well be advanced by Israeli-Palestinian or Israeli-Syrian accords on terms Israel doesn't like very much at all."
p784
aS'On the other hand, the special relationship has deepened profound roots.'
p785
aS"Some is value-driven, reverends for the Holy Land by American Jews and Christians alike, respect for Israel's democratic institutions."
p786
aS'But some is highly strategic.'
p787
aS'Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East.'
p788
aS'It has, by far, the greatest military capability in the region, and is a major source of intelligence.'
p789
aS'And getting back to a nuclear Iran, Israel might well be our best shield.'
p790
aS'Israel did the U.S., in the region, a favor, I would argue, by bombing the Syrian reactor.'
p791
aS"Maybe it will do the dirty work again so we don't have to tolerate a nuclear Iran."
p792
aS'Against this complex backdrop, can we say that by holding hands with Israel, America is shooting itself in the foot?'
p793
aS'Should America step back from its special relationship?'
p794
aS"Tonight's debate is to provide some light on this vital issue, and it will surely provide lots of heat."
p795
aS"So it's my pleasure at this point to turn the proceedings over to our moderator John Donvan and the stellar group of panelists who are going to debate this resolution."
p796
aS'Thank you.'
p797
aS'John Donvan: Thank you.'
p798
aS"I'd just like to invite one more round of applause for the gentleman who makes all of these debates possible, Robert Rosenkranz."
p799
aS'Welcome, everyone, to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S..'
p800
aS"I'm John Donvan of ABC News."
p801
aS"And once again, it's my honor to serve as moderator."
p802
aS'As the floor debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.'
p803
aS'Four debaters, two at each table, are debating this motion, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p804
aS'" And I want to point out, this is a debate.'
p805
aS"It's not a panel discussion."
p806
aS'It is not a seminar.'
p807
aS'This is a debate.'
p808
aS"It's a contest, with winners and losers."
p809
aS'And you in our audience have the special role of choosing our winners.'
p810
aS'You are the judges in this debate.'
p811
aS"And by the time the evening has ended, you will have voted twice, once before and once after the debate on whether you agree or disagree with the motion, especially after what you've heard."
p812
aS'And the team that has changed the most minds at the end of the debate will be declared our winner.'
p813
aS"So let's go on to our first round of voting."
p814
aS'Once again, the keypads to your seats are your means to do that.'
p815
aS'If you agree with our motion, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel", you\'re to push number one.'
p816
aS'If you disagree, a "No" is number two.'
p817
aS"If at this point, you're undecided that's number three."
p818
aS'You can ignore the other numbers.'
p819
aS'And if you make a mistake, just correct it and the system will record your last entered number.'
p820
aS"So we'll have the results of that vote quite shortly."
p821
aS'We go in three rounds.'
p822
aS'We have opening statements of approximately seven minutes each.'
p823
aS'Then we go on to a middle section where the debaters talk directly to one another, prompted also by questions from myself and from you in the audience.'
p824
aS'And then at the end of the evening, each team has two minutes of closing remarks.'
p825
aS'On to round one then, let the debate begin.'
p826
aS'Our first debater, for the motion, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel", is Roger Cohen who will make his way to his lectern.'
p827
aS'Roger is a former foreign editor of The New York Times, a journalist who has traveled the world, who has himself the interesting story, you are Cohen, because when your dad left South Africa and moved to the UK, he was advised that it will be a good idea to change his name from Cohen.'
p828
aS'And his answer was - Roger Cohen: His answer was - he suggested maybe Einstein.'
p829
aS'He stuck with Cohen and it worked.'
p830
aS'John Donvan: That\'s why tonight, I brought you Cohen, arguing for the motion, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p831
aS'" Roger Cohen: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.'
p832
aS'In life, when we fail, we call it stupidity to burrow deeper into failure.'
p833
aS'Measured by any standard, American policy toward Israel has failed over the past couple of decades.'
p834
aS'We are no closer to any kind of peace.'
p835
aS'Israelis and Palestinians today stand further apart than ever.'
p836
aS'They are estranged.'
p837
aS'They are mistrustful.'
p838
aS'They are antagonistic.'
p839
aS'They can scarcely even imagine peace.'
p840
aS'We will therefore submit to you tonight that rather than burrowing deeper into failure, and so jeopardizing American interest, the United States should reconsider its ties with Israel.'
p841
aS'It should step back from its special relationship in favor of a normal relationship.'
p842
aS'Now a normal relations between allies, and the United States and Israel must remain firm allies, are often marked by differences.'
p843
aS'With France, with Japan, with Germany, with Turkey, important allies all, America has regular and often open disagreements.'
p844
aS"What makes America's relationship with Israel is its uncritical nature, even when U.S. interests are being hurt."
p845
aS'What also makes the relationship special is the incredible largess that the United States shows towards Israel, over the past decade, $28.9 billion in economic aid.'
p846
aS"And on top of that, another $30 billion in military aid, that's almost $60 billion."
p847
aS"That's 10 times the GNP of Haiti that is being gifted to a small country."
p848
aS'Now, I ask you, to what end is this money being used.'
p849
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, we would submit that it ends often inimical to the America interest.'
p850
aS'Take the ongoing Israeli settlement program in the West Bank, at a cost of about $100 billion, this enterprise has grown the number of settlers in the West Bank from about 140,000 in 1996, to about 300,000 today.'
p851
aS"If you add the roughly 150,000 Israeli's in East Jerusalem, you get to a number of 450,000 Israelis beyond the 1997 border."
p852
aS"That's not all."
p853
aS'Money has poured into a repressive apparatus involving settler-only highways, reserved military areas, a separation or security barrier.'
p854
aS'The Israelis call it "separation wall", "hated separated wall" the Palestinians call it, a barrier that burrows into the West Bank and annexes 10% of the land.'
p855
aS"What's the result of this?"
p856
aS'Well the result is an isolated, fragmented, atomized, fractured, humiliated Palestinian presence that simply makes a nonsense, at first, of the notion of "Two States for Two Peoples".'
p857
aS'What I observe there on my visits to the West Bank amounts to a kind of primer in colonialism.'
p858
aS'Imagine, Israelis in their fast cars, Blackberry-ing away, booming down these super highways, while Palestinians on their donkey carts make their way on dirt tracks, if they can get there, to their orchards.'
p859
aS'This is a primer in colonialism, much more than it resembles a nascent Palestinian state.'
p860
aS'Yet, "Two States for Two Peoples" is the declared U.S. objective.'
p861
aS'In effect, the United States is bankrolling the very Israeli policies that are dashing its own aims and the hopes for Oslo by making two states almost unimaginable.'
p862
aS'Does this make sense?'
p863
aS'Is that clever?'
p864
aS"I don't think so."
p865
aS"And if you don't think so, ladies and gentlemen, you should vote for the proposition tonight."
p866
aS'Now, the United States has raised its voice occasionally.'
p867
aS'Jim Baker, for example, Secretary of State in \'89, said, "Foreswear annexation.'
p868
aS'Stop settlement activity.'
p869
aS'" Now fast forward two decades to Barack Obama, in Cairo, two decades in several hundred thousand settlers, he said, "The United States does not accept legitimacy of the continued Israeli settlements.'
p870
aS'" And what did Prime Minister Netanyahu do two weeks ago, planted settlings in various settlements, and they are part - and said, "They are part of Israel for all eternity.'
p871
aS'" Now in a normal relationship, there would be consequences to such defiance.'
p872
aS'In a special relationship, the one that exists, there are no such consequences.'
p873
aS"Now, America's perceived complicity in Israeli violence carries a heavy price."
p874
aS'Jihadi terrorism aimed at the United States is not primarily motivated perhaps by the Palestinian issue, but it is a major factor.'
p875
aS'It is a potent terrorist recruitment tool.'
p876
aS'The United States should stand by its allies.'
p877
aS'And Israel is an ally.'
p878
aS'But if America is to pay the blood, and the treasure, and the last piece of mind that comes with supporting Israel, it should be ready at least to speak openly and critically of Israeli mistakes when needed.'
p879
aS"To boost, ladies and gentlemen, are unhealthy, a climate that affixes charges of anti-Semitism to anyone critical of Israel, and self-hating Jew to any Jew who's critical of Israel, is unhelpful."
p880
aS'For if there are not two states, there will be one state.'
p881
aS'And sooner or later, the number of Palestinians in it will outnumber the number of Jews.'
p882
aS'And what then will remain of the Zionist dream?'
p883
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, there's also a moral issue here."
p884
aS'I am a Jew.'
p885
aS'I know that Israel at its foundation and its declaration of independence said it would, "Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, and sex.'
p886
aS'" We, Jews, know in our bones what persecution is.'
p887
aS'Alas, and this is hard to say, Israel, has in my view, lost touch with these fundamental values.'
p888
aS'By uncritically supporting Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, America is undermining its own values, which at the very least stand for the absence of second class citizenship and equality of opportunity.'
p889
aS"Yes, I know Israel's a vibrant democracy isolated in the Middle East."
p890
aS'And its values are closer to ours than those at closed Arab societies.'
p891
aS"But that does not mean that we should endorse Israel's systematic dismemberment of the Two State option."
p892
aS"And if President Obama is serious about reaching out to the Muslim world, America must appear much more as an honest broker and less as Israel's spokesman."
p893
aS'And that requires a serious re-balloting.'
p894
aS'You will, I suspect, hear that Israel is a lonely David facing an Arab Goliath.'
p895
aS'You will hear that it needs blanket American support to be secure.'
p896
aS'This is simply not true.'
p897
aS'Nuclear-armed Israel is powerful.'
p898
aS'John Donvan: Roger Cohen, your time is up.'
p899
aS"Roger Cohen: The United States can step back while ensuring Israel's security."
p900
aS'And so I urge you to vote for the motion tonight.'
p901
aS'Thank you.'
p902
aS'John Donvan: Thank you, Roger Cohen.'
p903
aS'Our motion is, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel", and arguing first against the motion, Stuart Eizenstat, who has been a former ambassador to the European Union, but his career in government is astounding.'
p904
aS'When you go through his resume, he has had undersecretary positions in Commerce, in Treasury, in the State Department.'
p905
aS"You didn't get Agriculture?"
p906
aS'Not a farmer, ladies and gentlemen, Stuart Eizenstat.'
p907
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Thank you, John.'
p908
aS"I couldn't disagree more with Roger Cohen, and strongly oppose the notion that the United States should somehow stand back from its special relationship with Israel, and I do so for the following reasons."
p909
aS'First, if the United States would do so, it would betray the very principles upon which U.S. foreign policy is based.'
p910
aS'Unlike China, or Russia, or some of our European allies, our foreign policies since our founding founders have never been to avoid a morality.'
p911
aS'Indeed, morality is a central feature of our policy.'
p912
aS"As a first country to recognize Israel in 1947 after the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews, we would be betraying those principles were we to step back from the special relationship we've developed over 62 years."
p913
aS'Second, it would mean abandoning the only democratic, loyal, reliable ally in the region, which shares American values of democracy, rights for women, judicial independence, freedom of speech, and forming a 21st century culture.'
p914
aS"It's the only state in the region, which has a vibrant non-governmental sector so good on policies that Roger mentioned."
p915
aS'There are groups like Peace Now, BTselem, and others who are vibrantly and publicly opposing those policies, the only country in the region which permits that kind of debate and criticism of the government.'
p916
aS"In addition, it's not just American values, it is American interest."
p917
aS'Israel shares American interest in combating terrorism, in creating pro-Western moderate Arab states in the region, in stopping nuclear proliferation, and in having peace with all of its neighbors.'
p918
aS'In addition, if we were to withdraw that special relationship, it would be a sign of American inconstancy and weakness.'
p919
aS'What message would it send to other allies?'
p920
aS'Would they think they were going to be next on the chopping block?'
p921
aS'And indeed, to do so would only lead to more demands from those in the region.'
p922
aS"America has to stand behind its allies because if it doesn't, it will not have many left anywhere."
p923
aS'In addition, the whole notion of this motion misunderstands the major issues facing the United States in the region.'
p924
aS'And I have spent an enormous amount of time and energy in that region in multiple capacities.'
p925
aS'Issues that we have with Iraq and Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda are unrelated to our special relationship with Israel.'
p926
aS'Indeed, what is going on fundamentally in these states is a contest internally within the Arab world between modernizing states and radical Islamic states who want to create an Islamic caliphate for the whole region, unrelated to Israel, unrelated to Israel.'
p927
aS"It's also auspicious argument that somehow there's a zero-sum game that the kind of outreach that President Obama properly is providing to the Muslim world is somehow inconsistent with a special relationship with Israel."
p928
aS'And let me tell you from personal knowledge, there is no zero-sum game.'
p929
aS'We can, and do have, both.'
p930
aS'We have a very close relationship.'
p931
aS'And I spent a lot of time in countries like Egypt and in Jordan, and in the territories, and in the Gulf helping build that relationship.'
p932
aS'And indeed, let me point out that it is because of the special relationship with Israel that the Arab states know that the way in which Israel will make concessions is when it has a dependable American ally so that it can make those territorial concessions.'
p933
aS"And I've seen it happen at Camp David under President Carter, all of Sinai given back."
p934
aS"I've seen it happen with Jordan and the peace agreement with Jordan."
p935
aS"Roger says there's been no peace."
p936
aS"I mean, I don't know where you've been."
p937
aS'How about the Egyptian peace, which has lasted now for over 30 years, and the Jordanian peace?'
p938
aS'And those concessions continued.'
p939
aS'For example, Prime Minister Barack in the Clinton administration, in which I served at the second Camp David, offered 95% of the land, including East Jerusalem, to Yasser Arafat.'
p940
aS'And what was the response?'
p941
aS"No, that's where the second intifada occurred."
p942
aS'What was the response when Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza?'
p943
aS'What was the response?'
p944
aS'Rockets from Gaza, dismantling the settlements, dismantling 3,000 people, and that was the response.'
p945
aS'So it is auspicious argument that we can only have good relations with the Muslim world if we abandon Israel.'
p946
aS'Indeed, they know we need to have that relationship to convince Israel to make those concessions.'
p947
aS'In addition, where else will one have a special relationship and with whom else?'
p948
aS'The Saudis?'
p949
aS'The Saudis who export Wahabanism as well as expensive oil from whom 17 of the 19 9/11 terrorists came?'
p950
aS"Would it be Egypt where I've spent a great deal of time?"
p951
aS'I think we need stronger relations with Israel.'
p952
aS"It's on forth with Egypt."
p953
aS"It's a one-party state, 28 years the same president."
p954
aS'The opposition candidate was arrested when he ran against Mr. Mubarak.'
p955
aS'Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, where is the special relationship?'
p956
aS'And let me close with this thought, when you say, "Why don\'t we have peace with the Palestinians?'
p957
aS'" If there were a Martin Luther King, if there were a Mahatma Gandhi leading the Palestinian movement, they would have had statehood long, long, long ago.'
p958
aS'It is because there is no reliable Palestinian partner.'
p959
aS'It is because of the Hamas-Fatah problem.'
p960
aS'It is because when the Israeli public sees a withdrawal from Lebanon or a withdrawal on their own from Gaza, instead of reconciliation, they get rockets in response.'
p961
aS"That's why we don't have peace, not because Israel doesn't want peace."
p962
aS'And last, there are certain things with which we disagree with Israel as we do with all allies, settlement policy and so forth.'
p963
aS"I didn't notice, for example, that Germany, or the UK, or France is providing the kind of troops we want in Afghanistan."
p964
aS'You can have a special relationship with allies and not always agree.'
p965
aS'Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote against this pernicious motion, which would undercut the very basis of foreign policy in the United States.'
p966
aS'John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat, your time is up.'
p967
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: The only bipartisan foreign policy which we have in this country.'
p968
aS'Thank you.'
p969
aS'John Donvan: All right.'
p970
aS"Here's where we are."
p971
aS'We are halfway through the opening round of this have two teams of two facing it out over this motion, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel".'
p972
aS"You've heard the first two debaters."
p973
aS'Now we move on to the third.'
p974
aS"I'd like to introduce Rashid Khalidi who is a professor at Columbia University, a former adviser to the Palestinian delegation for the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations."
p975
aS'He was in Beirut during the Israeli bombing in 1982.'
p976
aS"He comes from - New York born, comes from a storied Jerusalem family who has bequeathed to the city of Jerusalem one of the world's leading libraries of Islamic literature, started by your grandfather, I believe?"
p977
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Yes.'
p978
aS'John Donvan: Ladies and gentlemen, Rashid Khalidi.'
p979
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.'
p980
aS'Thank you for braving the impending snowstorm.'
p981
aS"You've heard from our opponents, one of our opponents, a pattern that we've heard a great deal of."
p982
aS'And if you listen to the advocates of the special relationship with Israel, you would think that all is for the best and the best of all possible worlds.'
p983
aS"Well I'm here to tell you that it's not."
p984
aS'You heard from my colleague, Roger, exactly how bad the situation is.'
p985
aS'I strongly recommend the next time any of you have a chance to go to the Holy Land, that you take a little time away from your trip to Israel and spend some time in the West Bank, spend three or four days.'
p986
aS'And you will see precisely how bad it is.'
p987
aS'Now, I would be the last person, as a Middle East historian, to suggest that all the problems in the Middle East are caused by the U.S. special relationship with Israel.'
p988
aS"They're not."
p989
aS'There are problems with Arab governments.'
p990
aS'There are problems among the Palestinians.'
p991
aS'There are problems inside Israel.'
p992
aS'But some problems are caused by this special relationship.'
p993
aS'Let me just list a couple of them.'
p994
aS'One of them is that there is, as a result in large measure of our special relationship with Israel, an almost total deafness to public opinion in Palestine and in the Arab world.'
p995
aS"We hear the same kind of mantra about there's no democracy, there's no public sector."
p996
aS'There are all kinds of things going on in public opinion in the Arab world.'
p997
aS"And one of the things that's going on is a deep distrust and unease with U.S. policy over this issue in particular."
p998
aS'A second thing that has to be said is that there is a suspicion, in public opinion in particular all over the Arab world, of the fact that the United States in the Middle East because of this special relationship is not and cannot be an honest broker.'
p999
aS'Everybody knows that the United States engages in prior coordination with Israel, as a result of an agreement made by Secretary Kissinger back in the 70s, before anything starts between Arabs and Israelis.'
p1000
aS"Everybody knows, in other words, that there's a big fat U.S. thumb on the scales when the United States act as a mediator."
p1001
aS'I recall, in the negotiations in Washington, we were in an impasse with the Israeli side, and we were told, after much reluctance on their part, that the State Department of the United States would come with a bridging proposal.'
p1002
aS'We were very pleased.'
p1003
aS'They came with a bridging proposal that was worse than the position that the Israelis had offered us.'
p1004
aS'This is what the special relationship gives you.'
p1005
aS'It gives you a country that cannot act as an honest broker.'
p1006
aS'And let me say something about United States reliability.'
p1007
aS'Let me say something about what the United States looks like after 20 years when American presidents, since President Carter, have said not just that they were going to make peace with Egypt, which they did, but that they were going to make peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.'
p1008
aS'We have systematically failed in this effort over the past 20 years.'
p1009
aS'The situation is - 30 years in fact.'
p1010
aS'The situation is infinitely worse today than when Ambassador Rabinovich and I went to Madrid in October of 1991.'
p1011
aS"It's worse for the Palestinians."
p1012
aS"It's worse for the position the United States in the Arab world if you care not what autocratic governments think, but what the people think about us."
p1013
aS'And this brings me to the main reason you should vote for this proposition.'
p1014
aS'You should vote for this proposition, in our opinion, because the United States should be true to its principles.'
p1015
aS'It should be fair.'
p1016
aS'It should be equitable.'
p1017
aS'It should be just.'
p1018
aS'We give, as Roger said, $60 billion over the past 10 years to Israel.'
p1019
aS'We are in effect engaged in supporting an occupation that has been going on for 42 years and counting.'
p1020
aS'We are in effect underwriting settlements.'
p1021
aS"And we're not just using that with U.S. money that's fund - U.S. tax dollars out of our pockets that's fungible."
p1022
aS'We are doing that with tax deductible contributions to settlements, to projects in the occupied West Bank, and essentially to doing things that are directly opposed to United States policy and to the interest of the United States not to speak of the interest of peace in the Middle East.'
p1023
aS'We hear a great deal about security whenever Israel is talked about.'
p1024
aS"We have to be concerned with Israel's security."
p1025
aS'Fine, we have to be concerned with the security of everybody in this region if we are going to be an honest broker, if some people are not of a higher importance to us than other people.'
p1026
aS'What about the security of Palestinians?'
p1027
aS"In the recent war in Gaza, it wasn't really a war."
p1028
aS'It was a one-sided affair.'
p1029
aS'There were 14,000 people killed on one side and 14 on the other side.'
p1030
aS"If we're concerned with human security, we should be concerned with numbers like this."
p1031
aS'We should be concerned with the fact that everybody knows that we are engaged not just in funding, financing, supporting diplomatically, but also in selling weapons that are engaged in doing these kinds of things.'
p1032
aS'Now what can the United States do?'
p1033
aS'In my view, it can do many things.'
p1034
aS'It\'s not enough to say, "Oh, it\'s a shame.'
p1035
aS'The Palestinians are divided.'
p1036
aS'" The Palestinians are divided.'
p1037
aS'They have deep, deep internal divisions.'
p1038
aS'The United States has been working systematically to deepen those divisions.'
p1039
aS"The United States should be helping to unite the Palestinians around a consensus whereby they can come forward and negotiate, rather than trying to keep them divided as we've been trying to do if our objective is not to weaken them, which is an Israeli objective."
p1040
aS'If our objective is peace, then there has to be not just an Israeli consensus for peace, there has to be a Palestinian consensus for peace.'
p1041
aS'We have done everything possible to prevent this.'
p1042
aS'This is one thing that we can and should do.'
p1043
aS'What else can we do?'
p1044
aS'I would argue that our policy should be linked not solely to what the stronger party - by far the stronger party in this relationship wants.'
p1045
aS'That is no way to make peace.'
p1046
aS'Again and again, what the United States has an effect done is to help gang up on the Palestinians.'
p1047
aS'The United States has to pull away from this special relationship with Israel if it is to play any kind of effective role in making peace.'
p1048
aS'Now, this is particularly true because the hardest issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis, much harder than anything that had to be dealt with between Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt have to do with issues that resonate all over the Arab world, things like refugees, things like Jerusalem.'
p1049
aS'These are not easy issues.'
p1050
aS"If we stand with the stronger, as we have done consistently on these and other issues, if we stand with Israel and ignore the fact that these are not just things on which there's a claim on both sides, but most importantly, these are things that will negatively affect U.S. interests."
p1051
aS'If we take a one-sided position, we are harming U.S. interests throughout the region.'
p1052
aS'If you vote against this proposition, I would argue, you are voting for the status quo.'
p1053
aS'You are voting for more of the same.'
p1054
aS'You are voting for a peace process that has delivered a lot of process and no peace.'
p1055
aS'And that is what we have gotten from every administration up to this point.'
p1056
aS'We have peace with Egypt.'
p1057
aS'We have with Jordan.'
p1058
aS'Peace with the Palestinians is much farther away.'
p1059
aS'I would suggest that voting for this status quo is to say in effect, "We\'re going to bury our heads in the sand.'
p1060
aS"We're going to allow a Two States solution to disappear."
p1061
aS'" I personally don\'t think it has very many changes anymore.'
p1062
aS'But if this is something that is important, if we do not want the future for Israel that many Israelis see, where Israel continues to rule over the Palestinians, we should vote in favor of this proposition.'
p1063
aS'Thank you very much.'
p1064
aS'John Donvan: Our motion is, "The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel".'
p1065
aS'And our last debater, arguing against this motion, Itamar Rabinovich is a former Israeli Ambassador to the United States.'
p1066
aS'He was on the White House lawn when Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shook hands.'
p1067
aS'He has seen what he felt Israeli locations peace come here.'
p1068
aS'His book on "The Brink of Peace" was about his involvement in negotiations with the Syrians.'
p1069
aS'It went to the brink, and then pulled back.'
p1070
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, Itamar Rabinovich.'
p1071
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: Thank you.'
p1072
aS'I urge you strongly to vote against the motion.'
p1073
aS"I think that the motion indicates a desire to destroy the United States' most important, most successful relationship in a very important part of the world."
p1074
aS'What does special relationship mean?'
p1075
aS'It does not mean that the tail is wagging the dog.'
p1076
aS'It is a mutual relationship.'
p1077
aS'I was an ambassador to Washington for nearly four years.'
p1078
aS'I was a peace negotiator that worked very closely with the United States peace team.'
p1079
aS'And I know how many disagreements we have had over the years with our American colleagues.'
p1080
aS'How many times, what we call, pressure was brought to bear on Israeli decision makers, even presidents who were considered very friendly.'
p1081
aS'Bill Clinton, considered a great friend of Israel, he was a close friend of Yitzhak Rabin.'
p1082
aS"He admired Rabin, but I've seen them argue fiercely."
p1083
aS"And I've seen Rabin yield to Clinton because he was the President of the United States, the senior partner in this special relationship."
p1084
aS'Now, what is special about the relationship?'
p1085
aS"It's special."
p1086
aS"It's unique because you have unusual loyalty on both sides."
p1087
aS'We have many relationships around the world as we have mentioned.'
p1088
aS'Israel relationship with France is so close.'
p1089
aS"Doesn't France undermine U.S. interests and policies in parts of the world?"
p1090
aS"Japan is a close ally, look at the arguments you're having with Japan over stationing of U.S. troops in Japan."
p1091
aS'You will not have such an argument with Israel because there are no U.S. troops stationed in Israel.'
p1092
aS"It's a very close military and strategic alliance defined, among other things, by the fact that Israel does not want American troops to be stationed in Israel."
p1093
aS"Israel wants to look out for its own security with American help, with American weapons and equipment, but on its own, and not having to station troops in Israel or in that part of the Middle East because Israel is there, it's a huge advantage."
p1094
aS'Because look at the other side of the Middle East, an important part of the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, countries that are of enormous influence or importance for the United States.'
p1095
aS'You have troops there.'
p1096
aS'You have many American troops at a huge cost in Iraq.'
p1097
aS'You have troops in Afghanistan.'
p1098
aS'You have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.'
p1099
aS'And remember, what did the Al- Qaeda terrorists say once they exploded into the World Trade Center, the first reason they cited for the U.S. - for attacking the U.S. is that the United States has troops on sacred Muslim soil in the Arabian peninsula.'
p1100
aS"In Israel or near Israel, you don't need to station U.S. troops."
p1101
aS"It's a very close alliance."
p1102
aS"It's an alliance based on mutuality, on a full loyalty on both sides, acceptance of, of course, the seniority of the United States in that relationship."
p1103
aS'And this relationship serves you in an area in which many American interests are focused.'
p1104
aS'Now, the argument of the people who put this for a vote, the argument of our opponents in this debate is that support to Israel undermines American position in our republic opinion and reinforces Arab and Muslim tendency to terrorism against the United States.'
p1105
aS'Wrong.'
p1106
aS'What the Arabs resent most is, that is American military presence, American support for dictatorial regimes.'
p1107
aS'Let me read a very perceptive comment written awhile ago.'
p1108
aS'Iraq has changed everything in Washington, the city obsessed with the President.'
p1109
aS'It was easy to forget that as recently as a few years ago, the United States was not particularly disliked in the Middle East, and that Al-Qaeda was a tiny underground organization with almost no popular support, very perceptive professor Khalidi who wrote these lines.'
p1110
aS'So we are in agreement on a few things but we take different conclusions from that.'
p1111
aS'So another complaint that I have against our opponents in this debate, first of all too much was focused on the Palestinian issue.'
p1112
aS"It's very important issue, it's important first and foremost for us."
p1113
aS"I'm one of those Israelis who desperately believe in fight for having a two state solution."
p1114
aS"I think it's dangerous for Israel to keep the states poor."
p1115
aS'Now there are people in Israel who think otherwise and politically we disagree.'
p1116
aS'In the United States and this Government of Israel do want to see a two state solution.'
p1117
aS'But the President problem is not the only one.'
p1118
aS'He said there is peace with Egypt, there is peace with Jordan and normal relations with quite a few Arab countries and that has been achieved by the United States precisely as my colleague Stu Eizenstat said, because the United States is the power, the great power that has the ability to influence to work with Israel.'
p1119
aS'And Arab countries who want to see a change.'
p1120
aS'Syria if it wants the Golan back knows that their road to the Golan leads to Washington, not through Tehran.'
p1121
aS'So, actually the closest to Israel, the perception in the Arab world that the United States has that sway with Israel is one of the most important assets that United States has.'
p1122
aS'And believe me I spent hundreds of hours talking to the Syrians as the peace negotiator with Syria, and I know exactly full well.'
p1123
aS'They wanted to make peace with Israel because that was a pathway to Washington.'
p1124
aS'They work with Washington, you know, that to make peace with Israel.'
p1125
aS'Finally much of what you heard from our opponents earlier this evening was actually in the frame of the Bush years.'
p1126
aS'We are not in the Bush years any more.'
p1127
aS'For year there has been another administration in Washington and actually what we have seen it was President Obama who listened to such advice and begun by taking some distance from Israel.'
p1128
aS'He went to Cairo; he gave the speech to the Muslim world.'
p1129
aS"He didn't go to Israel."
p1130
aS'What is the result, the result is the current impulse.'
p1131
aS'It was a mistake to take even one step, because the voices that we heard from the Arab world was you took one step go all the way, that is a mistake.'
p1132
aS'So the policy should be stay with the special relationship with Israel and together with Israel, use it in order to make peace with the Middle East including with the Palestinians.'
p1133
aS'John Donvan: And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p1134
aS'And we now have the results of our live audience vote.'
p1135
aS'We asked you before the debate begun where you stood on our motion the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel before the debate began here is word stood 33% of you were for the motion, 42% against and 25% were undecided.'
p1136
aS'Now one to round two, ended round two the debaters is going to address one another directly.'
p1137
aS'I will asks some questions of them and we will come to you and the audience to ask the questions and I once again want to urge you very much like a participation but we ask you to think in terms of the question, think in terms of something that you can say in 40 seconds, think in terms of something has question mark in the end and that is also on topic.'
p1138
aS'But I where I want to begin this, I want to go to the side that is arguing against the motion which argued in part particularly Stuart Eizenstat who served in so many administrations and was involve in this region.'
p1139
aS'Argued that turning away from Israel at this point would be an immoral act because Israel has been such a loyal ally for so long and I want to put to that side to either gentleman the question.'
p1140
aS'So what would actually happen to Israel if the U.S. created more distance?'
p1141
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Well, what would happen is that the United States would lose the levers and influence it has, and it has used to encourage Israel to make the concessions that it is made.'
p1142
aS"It's inconceivable for example that Israel would have given up all the sign at Camp David one with President Carter to each."
p1143
aS"If it didn't know that the United States was solidly and affirmably in its corner and the same is true with respect to other concessions that Israel made."
p1144
aS"These depend on a mutuality of interest and what I'll mention John and my closing points is the very specific concrete benefits that relationship with Israel provides to the United States."
p1145
aS'They are very concrete from intelligent sharing, to missile technology sharing to standing shoulder-to-shoulder to oppose Iranian nuclear threats.'
p1146
aS'So the interests are not just values, they are profound U.S. national security interest, but again, the direct answer to your question is, it would send a signal to Israel of inconsistency as it would be less likely make concessions - but they would say the same to all other allies, but what it would say - John Donvan: But would it be harmful for Israel is one of the questions - Stuart Eizenstat: It would very harmful for Israel because Israel would be completely alone.'
p1147
aS'Where else does it have a very close relationship?'
p1148
aS'To whom else would it turn for support?'
p1149
aS'I mean in the 1967 war, at the maximum time of their danger, all right when the state was almost eliminated by all the Arab countries, their prime arms supplier was not the United States of America, it was France.'
p1150
aS'And in the midst of the war, that arms shipments were totally cut off, a 100% cut off.'
p1151
aS'So Israel has nowhere else to turn as a major ally other than the United States, it would feel increasingly isolated.'
p1152
aS'It would be much more intractable in terms of the peace process, and I think it would be a terrible thing both for Israel and for the United States.'
p1153
aS"John Donvan: To the other side, is it an act of betrayal to put distance- Roger Cohen: No, it's not an act of betrayal."
p1154
aS'With respects to nobody is arguing for a divorce here.'
p1155
aS'Nobody is arguing that Israel should cease being an ally of the United States.'
p1156
aS"So, we are simply arguing that when President Obama says that he wants settlements to stop and settlements continue and Prime Minister Netanyahu declares that some settlements are Israel's for all eternity, that there should be consequences, and I believe that if the United States were firmer if it made clear to Israel that there are indeed consequences, then Israel would measure its actions much more carefully and there would be more chance of getting a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks, which are currently paralyzed."
p1157
aS'Israel, if it thinks it can act with complete impunity is not going to be responsive to U.S. desires.'
p1158
aS'John Donvan: Let me go to Itamar, he is looking at- Itamar Rabinovich: Briefly I like to say of course, it would not be good for Israel if the U.S. walked away from the special relationship.'
p1159
aS'There would be both substantive and a perception issue of weakening Israel.'
p1160
aS'Israel would go to the right, maybe to the radical right.'
p1161
aS'My point what is going to happen to the United States.'
p1162
aS'Now, let me read sentence from the most unlikely source.'
p1163
aS"If you go this week's New Yorker, Seymour Hersh discussion with Bashar Assad, the President of Syria, says, now the problem is that the United States is weaker and whole - in financial world, is weak as world."
p1164
aS'You always need power to do politics and nobody is doing politics.'
p1165
aS'What you need is a strong United States with good politics not weaker United States.'
p1166
aS"For United States it walks away from Israel it sends the signal of weakness inconsistent, it's not going to be good for U.S. policy."
p1167
aS'John Donvan: Rashid Khalidi Rashid Khalidi: I think this is like telling us when you are deep hole, the thing to do is dig deeper.'
p1168
aS'I mean we have enabled, we have enabled, the worst instincts of Israel politics.'
p1169
aS'We have enabled and supported and financed the worst policies in terms of, leave aside American interest.'
p1170
aS'We are all Americans that should be the only thing that matters to us.'
p1171
aS'Israeli interest, why is occupation and settlement in the Israeli interest?'
p1172
aS'Ambassador Rabinovich is opposed, is an opponent of these things.'
p1173
aS'Most right thinking Israelis that most of know are but Israeli politics is moving exactly the opposite direction.'
p1174
aS'What we are doing is enabling these tendencies.'
p1175
aS'Let me say one other thing about constancy.'
p1176
aS'When we are doing something that everybody in the world think is dominant.'
p1177
aS'The idea of staying the course does not make us look constant, it makes us look dumb.'
p1178
aS'And our allies we were asked rhetorically by one of my opponents, if United States moved away from the special relationship what will happen with some of our allies, they would applaud.'
p1179
aS'They see the United States as systematically weakening itself by this perverse special relationship.'
p1180
aS'John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat, what about that very point that our allies would actually applaud readjustment to number of relationships?'
p1181
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Two things.'
p1182
aS'First of all when Roger says he is not calling for a divorce, okay.'
p1183
aS'Sometimes it difficult for spouses and countries to tell the difference between a separation and a divorce.'
p1184
aS'The implications can be the same.'
p1185
aS'And second, I was ambassador to the European Union.'
p1186
aS'I have spent an enormous amount of time in Europe.'
p1187
aS'I can tell you that it would send a chill down the spine of every ally we have in Europe and around the world if this relationship were abandoned.'
p1188
aS'Because they would say, we will next on chopping block.'
p1189
aS'It would a terrible side of inconstancy what the world wants is a strong constant United States that stands behind its principles, that stands behind its value and stands behinds its allies.'
p1190
aS'Roger Cohen: If I may- John Donvan: Roger Cohen.'
p1191
aS'Roger Cohen: With respect I also spend a lot time in the European Union not as an ambassador.'
p1192
aS'And my perception of European publics and European governments is that many are bewildered by the extent and degree of U.S. support for Israel and would applaud some modification of that relationship.'
p1193
aS'John Donvan: The side arguing for the motion I said that made a rather cogent argument, quite logical that U.S. relationship with Israel raises the question whether the United States can be an honest broker in the Middle East.'
p1194
aS'What - take that on either side-against the motions.'
p1195
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: We both seen it from different perspective myself and United States perspective and get is really perspective.'
p1196
aS'Every moderate care country knows that only the United States can talk to both sides.'
p1197
aS'It is the only honest broker.'
p1198
aS'And indeed if it were to withdraw from that special relationship it would lose the capacity to have then ear of the Israelis in a way it does now.'
p1199
aS"It is an honest broker that's why even though there is a quartet with the UN and Russia and so forth and the EU."
p1200
aS"It's only the United States, the Secretaries of State, the President who were the active ingredients in the Peace process."
p1201
aS'The Arab states know that, Europeans know that, Israelis know that, and so we are accepted as the honest broker.'
p1202
aS'And again, I think that Itamar is right, you are retreading Bush, we have got a different President who has reached out to the Muslim world and who said entire world, yes, we want to have stronger relationships with the Muslim world.'
p1203
aS"Yes, we want to have a two states solution but yes we stand firmly behind the state of Israel as a Jewish State, that's being an honest broker and that's what accepted on all sides."
p1204
aS'John Donvan: Does the other side agree that President Obama is changing the game?'
p1205
aS"Rashid Khalidi: I'd actually like to say something about this honest broker thing."
p1206
aS"I don't think United States in any way an honest broker."
p1207
aS'United States is quite frequently the only broker because United States hugs the stage.'
p1208
aS'Look at what the United States does to the quartet, it essentially tries to turn them into bunch of oodles who will follow the American lead, it successfully does that quite frequently even with European Union and with the Russians.'
p1209
aS'And I think this is actually a problem.'
p1210
aS'We have seen more constructive diplomacy in the Middle East from Qatar and Turkey; incidentally an important Democratic ally.'
p1211
aS'A country with a public sphere.'
p1212
aS'A major ally over decades going back to launching of NATO.'
p1213
aS'The only democracy in the Middle East is not Israel.'
p1214
aS'And we have seen more constructive diplomacy from those two countries than we have seen from the United States over the past several years as far as brokering a peace between or trying to broker a peace.'
p1215
aS"For example, arranging a settlement of the conflict in Lebanon, and I would suggest that it is in the United States' interest to bring others in."
p1216
aS"It's in the United States interest to make this a multilateral settlement."
p1217
aS'James Baker, to his enormous credit, understood this.'
p1218
aS"And that's one of the most important achievements of Madrid."
p1219
aS'It was to bring other parties in, that United States has this tendency to monopolize things.'
p1220
aS'It is a tendency to be resistant.'
p1221
aS'John Donvan: Do you see President Obama changing the game?'
p1222
aS"Roger Cohen: I think the president's problem at the moment is that he's gone a long way in words with the Cairo speech, with the speech in Istanbul, with other gestures."
p1223
aS'But when it comes to actions, and people are looking at actions, I think the Palestinians tend to see more of the same.'
p1224
aS'And that is the issue here.'
p1225
aS'Can we be imaginative?'
p1226
aS'Can we think outside of the box?'
p1227
aS'Look, when the Oslo Accord came in the 1990s, the PLO Charter still existed.'
p1228
aS'It existed until 1996 in its original form calling for the annihilation of Israel.'
p1229
aS'Now did this stop the imaginative negotiators in the 1990s from moving that process forward.'
p1230
aS'Oslo was 1993; this was done while the charter still existed.'
p1231
aS'The Hamas charter calling for annihilation of Israel is vile.'
p1232
aS'It is unacceptable.'
p1233
aS'But can we think outside the box about these things?'
p1234
aS'Can we look for new forms of engagement?'
p1235
aS'Can we think and act in different ways that might advance peace?'
p1236
aS'I think, so far, the verdict on the Obama administration and on what Mr. Mitchell has been trying to achieve is no.'
p1237
aS'And I it is important that we look at the Middle East the way it is, not the way we would like it to be or imagine it might be, but what the reality of this increasingly sophisticated Middle East is today what is Hamas really?'
p1238
aS'What is bothered really?'
p1239
aS"Let's look at these things in a hard headed way and let's think about and find some new ideas."
p1240
aS"And I think right now the president in a half way house and that's why we seeing no movement."
p1241
aS'John Donvan: I want to let Itamar Rabinovich answer that question but I - after that I get to questions from the audience, so Id like to disperse our microphones and bring the light up.'
p1242
aS'Itamar your response?'
p1243
aS"Itamar Rabinovich: You know President Obama's--some distancing from Israel."
p1244
aS'Abu Mazen, President of the Palestinian authority is not joining the negotiations now.'
p1245
aS'Because he says President Obama, you put me up on a tree, you have to help me climb down.'
p1246
aS'Because President Obama seemed to be taking a pro-Palestinian anti-Israel position at the outset.'
p1247
aS'His expectation was that the Muslim and Arab world will applaud.'
p1248
aS'The real reaction was give us more.'
p1249
aS'We will not come to the negotiations, you have to deliver Israel.'
p1250
aS'It was a very bad mistake.'
p1251
aS"And Roger when you say, think out of the box about the Hamas charter, which is not an anti-Israeli, an anti- Semitic document, speaking about the protocols of Zion, I don't know how to think outside the box about that, I would rather be in the box."
p1252
aS'John Donvan: Roger Cohen Roger Cohen: So was charter of the PLO.'
p1253
aS'It got changed and how did it get changed?'
p1254
aS'It got changed through negotiations.'
p1255
aS'John Donvan: Can you respond to that Itamar?'
p1256
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: Yes.'
p1257
aS'You can negotiate with a secular nationalist movement like the Fatah.'
p1258
aS'Hamas is a radical religious fundamentalist organization and you cannot negotiate with people who have these strong religious convictions.'
p1259
aS'John Donvan: Itamar- Rashid Khalidi: Israel is negotiating with them.'
p1260
aS'Israel is negotiating with prisoner release with Hamas right now.'
p1261
aS'Israel negotiates with Hamas all the time.'
p1262
aS'In fact it suits Israel perfectly, perfectly to have Hamas and Fatah divided and to have nobody to talk to.'
p1263
aS'You will have peace in this part of the world between Palestinians and Israelis when there is not just a Israeli consensus but a Palestinian consensus.'
p1264
aS'There are enough people in Hamas who are interested in a resolution of this conflict that if, as Roger said if you think outside the box, we could get something.'
p1265
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: So, when Ehud Olmert went out of his way and offered much more than Ehud Barak and any other Israeli politician, put it on the table, why did Abu Mazen not take it?'
p1266
aS'John Donvan: Let me go to questions from the audience.'
p1267
aS'We are going to leave a lot of things hanging because we will keep going.'
p1268
aS'We will come back.'
p1269
aS'You can put that question to him, I want to move on to this.'
p1270
aS'And if one of you wants to take that question back you are welcome to us, write down and see the gentlemen.'
p1271
aS'Unidentified Participant: Thank you.'
p1272
aS"John Donvan: Please stand up and if you're with the media, let's known."
p1273
aS'Zead Ramadan: My name is Zead Ramadan, I am the President of the Council on American Islamic Relations in New York.'
p1274
aS'It was often said of Yasser Arafat that he never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.'
p1275
aS'Is it - have we come into the era where Israel is starting to make decisions in its worst interest that Charles Freeman, who was a nominee for one of the top intelligence posts in the United States criticized them and said that himself before he pulled his nomination due to criticism from Israel and American elected officials.'
p1276
aS'Are we entering an era where Israel continuously make decisions and hurts its future?'
p1277
aS'John Donvan: How would you relate that also to U.S. interest which is our topic tonight?'
p1278
aS'Zead Ramadan: Absolutely.'
p1279
aS"We - as an American, I think back as a Palestinian myself, I am jaded whenever they say, whether it's Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Bush senior or junior, it's always said that we are going to work towards peace in the Middle East, and it always seems like an Israeli Prime Minister is pitching the phrase with the U.S. President and says, 'it doesn't matter what you say."
p1280
aS"We're going to do whatever we want to do and we still going to take your billions from you all the time'."
p1281
aS"So as my tax dollars are going to build settlements where John Donvan: Yeah, I do need a question, what's your question?"
p1282
aS'Zead Ramadan: I apologize.'
p1283
aS"John Donvan: No, I want a question, that's on a topic."
p1284
aS'Ziad Ramadan: Is it in the U.S. interest to support Israel financially while they continuously disagree with John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat to decide.'
p1285
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: A couple of things, first, several people have mentioned including Roger inaccurately that the United States continues to provide huge amounts of economic aid to Israel.'
p1286
aS'I can tell you that during the first Olmert government, they came to me when I was Undersecretary of State and they said we are now a highly developed country.'
p1287
aS"We don't need, and we don't want that economic assistance and they came to us and I negotiated the total cut off of that aid."
p1288
aS'There is not a nickel in economic aid being given to Israel.'
p1289
aS'The aid now is all economics.'
p1290
aS'John Donvan: Roger Cohen.'
p1291
aS"Stuart Eizenstat: And the aid is all given for security purposes and not economic purposes, it's all security."
p1292
aS'Roger Cohen: Congressional report just put the total at $28.9 billion over the past decades so how you can state there is no economic aid going from United States to Israel.'
p1293
aS"I don't know."
p1294
aS'In response to your questions I - critics of Israel are often told that they are anti Israeli.'
p1295
aS'My response is no, I think in have the long-term interest of Israel in my heart and to say that it is Israels interest to go on building these settlements strikes me as the height of foolishness because what will be the result of this?'
p1296
aS'We are at the point or we are very close to the point where a two state solution becomes impossible.'
p1297
aS'At that point, we are talking about a single state between the river and the sea.'
p1298
aS'That state will very soon - such a state will very soon have more Palestinian Arabs in it than Jews.'
p1299
aS'What then is going to happen to the Zionist dream?'
p1300
aS"And I think to point this out to Israel, is in fact acting in Israel's self interest, and the unfortunate thing about U.S. policy is it doesn't - without stepping back it doesn't act strongly enough to stop Israel making a two-states solution impossible."
p1301
aS'And I think that is the very core of the issue here.'
p1302
aS'John Donvan: Gentlemen with eye glasses, sorry?'
p1303
aS'Unidentified Participant: Question for Mr. Cohen and Khalidi.'
p1304
aS'John Donvan: Could you bring the mike a little bit closer?'
p1305
aS'Unidentified Participant: When Stuart Eizenstat said earlier on in the debate that had the Palestinians had a Palestinian version of Gandhi or King it would have been a two states solution a long time ago.'
p1306
aS'Is that a statement with which you agree or disagree, and if you disagree, why?'
p1307
aS'And separately, what is the answer to the question that we lost as we transitioned into the Q&A, why did Abu Mazen turn down the deal?'
p1308
aS'John Donvan: Thank you.'
p1309
aS"Rashid Khalidi: Why don't I answer that question first?"
p1310
aS'Abu Mazen does much of what he does because he is weak.'
p1311
aS'He is weak because we have made him weak.'
p1312
aS'He is weak for other reasons as well.'
p1313
aS'But a primary reason is because Israel and the United States have systematically undermined him.'
p1314
aS'What happened with the Goldstone report?'
p1315
aS"I don't want to go into the Goldstone report."
p1316
aS'Abu Mazen was pressured, was blackmailed, was threatened by the Israelis to, in effect prevent the consideration by United Nations Human Rights body of a report that was critical both of Hamas and especially of Israel.'
p1317
aS'This is an example of the kind of situation that Abu Mazen is in.'
p1318
aS'Why is he in this situation?'
p1319
aS'He is in the situation because he does not represent all the Palestinians, and he is in that situation because the Palestinian coalition government which would have included have Hamas was something that was strongly opposed both by Israel and the United States.'
p1320
aS'And that would have been a government in which Hamas would have authorized Abu Mazen to ahead and negotiate with Israel.'
p1321
aS'That would have been a government that might conceivably have reached an agreement or might not have.'
p1322
aS'But it certainly would have better than the situation we are in.'
p1323
aS'And let just create one point about the special relationship.'
p1324
aS'One of the things that the special relationship does is it imports Israeli considerations into U.S. law.'
p1325
aS"I was told by an American official one of the reasons we can't have a Palestinian coalition government which might in fact be a better negotiating partner is because it's against U.S. law."
p1326
aS'We would have to cut-off our funding to any government that included Hamas even a government that authorized negotiations for peace.'
p1327
aS'That is an example of why we should end this special relationship.'
p1328
aS'John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat.'
p1329
aS"Stuart Eizenstat: I want to answer the question and connect an important thread and say something I haven't said publicly before because there is a connection."
p1330
aS'I sat with Yasser Arafat in his office in Romala three weeks before Camp David who was suppose to start with President Clinton and Prime Minister Barak.'
p1331
aS"He said to me, tell President Clinton not to invite me, I'm not ready to go and to negotiate."
p1332
aS"Likewise the reason why Arafat wouldn't go or didn't want to go and why he turned down a remarkable concession from Barak, 95% of the territory, East Jerusalem is the capital is the same reason that Abu Mazen wouldn't accept and even more generous offer from all Olmert and that is they are afraid they will be assassinated by Hamas."
p1333
aS"That's point blank the reason."
p1334
aS'And the radicals in the Palestinian movement who I do not believer in a majority have a tremendous hammer-hold over the moderate.'
p1335
aS"John Donvan: Let's go to another question."
p1336
aS'Gentleman, yes, yellow tie.'
p1337
aS'You can stand and - I owe you a comeback.'
p1338
aS'Unidentified Participant: My question is very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. security John Donvan: Can you bring your microphone up a little bit?'
p1339
aS'Unidentified Participant: Sorry.'
p1340
aS'Very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. security, you talked a lot about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and how the special relationships affect, the special relationship affect the peace process, but very specifically how would change in this relationship affect U.S. security interest specifically vis--vis the jihadi elements who are working against the U.S.. How would that relationship either improve their view of the U.S. or be a detriment to the U.S.?'
p1341
aS'John Donvan: I was just talking about the impact on our allies, you are asking about the impact on our relationship with our foes, which side would like to take that.'
p1342
aS'Roger Cohen: Well, I think if you can advance a Middle East peace clearly you are going to withdraw, remove, a very powerful recruitment tool - for the jihadis.'
p1343
aS"If you look at Osama Bin Laden's speeches going back a very long way."
p1344
aS"If you look in the 9/11 report it what Khalid Sheikh Mohammad said, the mastermind of 9/11 about how policy toward the Palestinians was really what drove him toward the - It wasn't his stay in the United States."
p1345
aS'It was what he observed of U.S. Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.'
p1346
aS'So, if you can appear more as an honest broker, if you can move this paralyzed process in some way, then I think you could advance U.S. security in that respect.'
p1347
aS'Look have the Palestinians made mistakes, have there been office on the table that should perhaps have been accepted, yes.'
p1348
aS"But we're not talking about the past."
p1349
aS"We're talking about trying to move forward here, that is what this debate is about tonight, and I think to throw out the Olmert offer when he was already had great legal difficulties, was on his way out of office, it really wasn't credible at that point."
p1350
aS"So I don't find that in any way persuasive."
p1351
aS'John Donvan: Itamar Rabinovich Itamar Rabinovich: Two issues, one, terrorism, that support for Israel increases terrorism, and you all know New Yorkers, you live in New York, open the magazine last week, very interesting story about a young man from Alabama, Omar Hammami, who grew up in a small town in Alabama, and he is now fighting with Al Qaeda in Somalia.'
p1352
aS'Very interesting long article in the New York Times magazine.'
p1353
aS"The word Israel doesn't appear once."
p1354
aS'He became a terrorist not because of Israel but because of other reasons.'
p1355
aS'Secondly, I want to go back to the point raised by Stuart Eizenstat before.'
p1356
aS'Gandhi, other leaders.'
p1357
aS'Abu Mazen is not weak because the United States or Israel weakened him.'
p1358
aS'He is weak because he is weak.'
p1359
aS'Where you have - even people who made peace, Gandhi was not made by the British, Mandela was not made by the Americans and King Hussein and Anwar El Sadat who signed peace with Israel were strong leaders.'
p1360
aS"That's why they could take their countries to peace."
p1361
aS'But unfortunately, we have not had the kind of Palestinian leader who would become, who could become the Palestinian Mandela, who would bring about the rapprochement, the reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.'
p1362
aS'This comes from an Israeli who wants that.'
p1363
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Let me say something.'
p1364
aS'Let me say something.'

p1366
aS'He headed an armed movement.'
p1367
aS'He was not an apostle of non-violence.'
p1368
aS'He led an armed movement that succeeded in forcing a political resolution of a conflict.'
p1369
aS'Now, I personally am a believer in this conflict, now, that non-violent means are the best means for the Palestinians.'
p1370
aS"I don't think, however, that we should get too mystical about this."
p1371
aS'There are many colonial, many oppressive, many occupation regimes that would never ever disappeared but for armed violent resistance.'
p1372
aS"That is something that - that is something that's very painful to say because in this country, we have a constitution, and what Martin Luther King was calling for was that we live up to the highest principles of this country."
p1373
aS'I argue that in the Palestinian case, that would be appropriate, although for other reasons.'
p1374
aS'But to say in a situation of occupation, and in a situation of oppression, this is not two equal parties.'
p1375
aS'These are not two states.'
p1376
aS'There is one country between the Mediterranean and the sea.'
p1377
aS'It occupies the entirety of the territory.'
p1378
aS"It's the only sovereign state."
p1379
aS'It has ruled every single Palestinian in that territory, some of them as citizens of the State of Israel, a minority, four million of them as helots with no rights for 43 years, resistance in that case is legitimate.'
p1380
aS'John Donvan: Go back to the audience.'
p1381
aS'Unidentified Participant: Good evening.'
p1382
aS'Is it anti-semitism of United Nations which Israel and America always complains about that their 50 and odd resolutions requesting Israel to vacate the occupied land, Israel and America look the other way, but whereas when it comes to Iraq war, Bush Presidency on one resolution went for an illegal war.'
p1383
aS'This special arrangement between Israel and America is really hurting, in my opinion, and my question to one of the panelists will be, why are these resolutions not implemented, which are asking Israel to vacate the occupied land?'
p1384
aS"John Donvan: You're asking if U.S. has a double standard on UN resolution?"
p1385
aS'Unidentified Participant: U.S. has a double standard, Israel has a double standard.'
p1386
aS'John Donvan: Thank you.'
p1387
aS'Roger Cohen: The United States has vetoed.'
p1388
aS"John Donvan: Roger, I want to bring this to the insider first and then I'll come to you, okay?"
p1389
aS'Stuart Eizenstat.'
p1390
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: The UN Human Rights Commission has developed resolutions over the last decade and a half, two-thirds of which are directed at Israel, not in Iran, not in Iraq, not at all the human rights violations that occur around the world.'
p1391
aS'Two-thirds are directed to Israel.'
p1392
aS'This is grossly disproportionate.'
p1393
aS"Number two, with respect to general resolutions, let's go back to the first resolution of the United Nations, which was to create a two state solution."
p1394
aS'And Ben Gurion accepted a sliver of territory and it was rejected by the Arabs and that rejection has continued with the exception of Egypt and Jordan from 1947 to 2010.'
p1395
aS'John Donvan: Roger Cohen?'
p1396
aS'Roger Cohen: United States has vetoed more than 40 resolutions critical of Israel of recent years.'
p1397
aS"That's more I believe than all the vetoes put together of all the other members of the Security Council."
p1398
aS'This is indeed a special relationship.'
p1399
aS"And the question we're asking tonight is, is that really in the benefit of the United States and Israel?"
p1400
aS'And I would submit not.'
p1401
aS'If you look at the Goldstone report, the UN report on the war in Gaza, surely this report was imperfect.'
p1402
aS'No doubt there were errors in it.'
p1403
aS'I know Judge Goldstone.'
p1404
aS'I met him years ago and the Hague, believe me, he is balanced and intelligent man.'
p1405
aS"Did he make some mistakes, yes, but the Israeli reaction was, no this is just an expression of the world's bias, this is an outrage."
p1406
aS'This is absolutely unacceptable.'
p1407
aS'And the U.S. gave it some protection in that stance, which I consider to have been outrageous.'
p1408
aS'There is no justification for the position what is happened since.'
p1409
aS'Israel has quietly censured two generals.'
p1410
aS'It has agreed to pay compensation to the United Nations.'
p1411
aS"Behind the defiance, it has been making its own admissions of the fact that they were problems in this, and I think it is the United States' special relationship with Israel which allows it to say before the world, no, we never make mistakes, this is all a plot against us, and I don't think this is helpful to Israel."
p1412
aS'And it is not good for the United States to be in that position.'
p1413
aS'John Donvan: Itamar Rabinovich?'
p1414
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: The United Nations, the Human Rights Commission, do you know who are the members of that commission?'
p1415
aS'Who was the Chairman of that commission, the country called Libya.'
p1416
aS'Who is a member of that commission?'
p1417
aS'Zimbabwe with Mugabe.'
p1418
aS'Roger, you are from originally, you know South Africa and you know who Mugabe is.'
p1419
aS'So if the commission has Libya and Zimbabwe and countries like that, it has no moral authority and Goldstone drew his mandate from a place without moral authority.'
p1420
aS'John Donvan: Rashid Khalidi.'
p1421
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Yes.'
p1422
aS'As someone whose father works for the United Nations, I am going to defend this institution.'
p1423
aS'I think it ill - it does not behoove those who are friends of Israel to bash United Nations.'
p1424
aS'The certificate of Israel is delivered by the United Nations in the form of the resolution that Ambassador Eizenstat mentioned, the partition resolution of 1947.'
p1425
aS'Now that did not give the issue a sliver of Palestine.'
p1426
aS'It gave 33% of the population that owned 6% of the land, 55% of the country; some sliver.'
p1427
aS'Let me say a couple of other things.'
p1428
aS'I cannot let some of these things pass simply as a historian.'
p1429
aS'We are told that the Arab countries have been rejecting everything since 2010.'
p1430
aS'The majority of Arab countries came to the Madrid Peace Conference.'
p1431
aS'Ambassador Rabinovich and I saw them there.'
p1432
aS'Now what kind of rejection is it when they come to a peace conference.'
p1433
aS'They all voted in favor of an Arab peace resolution in Beirut and one before that, way back in 2002.'
p1434
aS'This is not rejection.'
p1435
aS'We were told about remarkable concessions.'
p1436
aS'Remember, when a country is in illegal occupation of territory and it agrees to give it back, there are various ways of talking about that.'
p1437
aS'I would not use the word concession.'
p1438
aS'Thirdly John Donvan: Rashid, I just want to ask you, how long is your list?'
p1439
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Pardon me?'
p1440
aS'John Donvan: How long is your list?'
p1441
aS'Rashid Khalidi: I have two more, but I will go for one.'
p1442
aS'John Donvan: Thank you.'
p1443
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Okay.'
p1444
aS'We were told that in 1967, Israel was almost eliminated.'
p1445
aS'If you go to the U.S. government documents and you go to the extraordinarily ample Israeli documentation, you will see that not one Israeli military intelligence or American military intelligence report or military officer of field rank and above thought that there was any chance of Israel being defeated let alone eliminated in the 1967 war.'
p1446
aS'I know people here believe that was a possibility, I know that many people in Israel feared it, but that was not a possibility at that time.'
p1447
aS'I could go on and on.'
p1448
aS'John Donvan: Okay, all right, I want to go back to a question here.'
p1449
aS'I need to do a little bit of announcing for radio.'
p1450
aS'I just want to remind everybody, we are in a question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p1451
aS"I'm John Donvan of ABC News acting as moderator."
p1452
aS'We have four debaters.'
p1453
aS'Two teams of two debating this motion, the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p1454
aS'The gentlemen standing now with grey suit, red tie?'
p1455
aS'John Girkoff: Thank you.'
p1456
aS'My Name is John Girkoff.'
p1457
aS'Among other things, I am affiliated with Tel Aviv University.'
p1458
aS"A question I have is - small statement, but then a question is all the attention tonight has been against Israel or for Israel or against the United States or for the United States, but the Palestinians have to start taking some responsibility for what's going on?"
p1459
aS'And the question I have is, what have they done over the last 40 years to instill the confidence in the United States, to maybe ease up on the relationship or become more, as you say, evenhanded and what can - do you think they should be doing or can be doing to instill the confidence that you two have that the United States should end that relationship?'
p1460
aS'John Donvan: Thank you for the question.'
p1461
aS'Good question.'
p1462
aS"Rashid Khalidi: It's a very good question."
p1463
aS"As someone who wrote a book recently about just this issue in Palestinian history about the responsibility of the Palestinians have to consider for things that have happened in Palestinian history not just in the last couple of decades, but going back to the 20s and 30s, I think it's a question that should be asked by Palestinians and to Palestinians, and I take the point."
p1464
aS'What can Palestinians do?'
p1465
aS'Firstly, they have to get their act together.'
p1466
aS"It's absolutely essentially that there be a Palestinian consensus on how to get out of the mess that they are in, and that's up to the Palestinians themselves."
p1467
aS"Nobody else can do that for them and that's the first thing."
p1468
aS"We are taking about Israel because that's the proposition before the house."
p1469
aS"You voted on something about the United States and Israeli special relationship, but I think it's a good question anyway because this is a key element of this problem."
p1470
aS'The Palestinians, I have to say, have not just been systematic divided by outside forces.'
p1471
aS'They have failed to unify themselves.'
p1472
aS'The Palestinians have not just failed to generate some of the leadership that I think they deserve.'
p1473
aS'I have been very critical of Palestinian leadership in the past.'
p1474
aS'It is however the case that their leadership has been systematically subject to assassination, not just by Israel, also by Arab governments, and they have problems not only with Israel, they have severe problems with all of the Arab governments with which they have to deal.'
p1475
aS"Governments which by and large are not democratic, governments which by and large do not represent their own people, and that's another problem that we're not discussing here, but which I think is well worth discussing."
p1476
aS'John Donvan: I just want to ask, are there no women with questions?'
p1477
aS'Thank you.'
p1478
aS"I didn't see you before."
p1479
aS"Right in the center, we're going to do three women in a row here now."
p1480
aS'Right in the center, do you have a microphone?'
p1481
aS"Okay, I'll come back, I will come to you."
p1482
aS'Rema Azazi: Thank you.'
p1483
aS'John Donvan: Can you bring the mike a little bit closer?'
p1484
aS'Rema Azazi: Thank you, can you hear me?'
p1485
aS"John Donvan: It's not on yet, try one more time."
p1486
aS"It's not your fault."
p1487
aS'Rema Azazi: Hi, can you hear me?'
p1488
aS'John Donvan: Yes.'
p1489
aS'Rema Azazi: Okay.'
p1490
aS"My name is Rema Azazi (ph), I'm Masters in Near-Eastern Studies at NYU."
p1491
aS'The idea of morality has been mentioned by both sides.'
p1492
aS"It's been mostly invoked by Mr. Eizenstat saying that we can't end this special relationship because it would be undermining the morality, that is what the special relationship is."
p1493
aS'And I would like to ask you, Mr. Eizenstat, why the principle of morality is not being applied to the case of the Palestinians?'
p1494
aS'So, when you discuss that justice and fairness is important, what would justice and fairness look like in the West Bank and Gaza?'
p1495
aS'What can Israel do for justice and fairness to exist there?'
p1496
aS'And can you also speak about justice and fairness for Palestinians who live in Israel and have Israeli citizenship?'
p1497
aS"I'm specifically thinking of the John Donvan: Are you asking what Israel can do or what the U.S. can do, because I would like to stay more towards Rema Azazi: U.S. and Israel?"
p1498
aS'John Donvan: Okay, thank you.'
p1499
aS'Fair enough.'
p1500
aS'Stuart Eizenstat.'
p1501
aS"Stuart Eizenstat: I think it's very good question and it is a moral imperative of the United States, not only to support Israel's independence and security, but also to see to it that the Palestinians have a decent standard of living and a state of their own."
p1502
aS'It is the United States of America that is the major economic supplier of aid to the Palestinians, okay?'
p1503
aS'Not France, not Germany, not the UK, not Russia, it is the United States.'
p1504
aS'Number two, right now as we speak, General Dayton, a three-star-general is in the process of training over 20,000 Palestinian police who are in places like Jenin now able to take over security and allowing the Israeli defense forces to withdraw allowing checkpoints to be reduced.'
p1505
aS'I met in Davos ten days ago, Prime Minister Fayyad, he is a great man.'
p1506
aS'He is a great man, he building a state from the bottom up.'
p1507
aS'He told me, Stu, we are going to have 10% real growth in the territories in the West Bank, and the reason is because the Palestinians are now under U.S. leadership, beginning to take on their own security, rooting out Hamas and giving the Israeli defense forces the confidence to withdraw.'
p1508
aS'So the United States is supporting economically, militarily, in every other way the effort of the Palestinians to develop their state.'
p1509
aS'And George Mitchell, who negotiated after many, many hard years, the Good Friday agreement on Northern Ireland is a superb negotiator.'
p1510
aS'He is there every month negotiating as an honest broker with a notion that we have a responsibility to the Palestinians as well as to the Israelis.'
p1511
aS'John Donvan: I want to come back to you because I saw how intently you were listening to.'
p1512
aS'What did you think of that answer?'
p1513
aS'Rema Azazi: (inaudible).'
p1514
aS"John Donvan: Yes, we will bring a mike, let's just get a mike come back to you, but I don't want to go on terribly long."
p1515
aS'I just want to know if it went to the point that you were asking about?'
p1516
aS'Rema Azazi: I would like to, is it on?, compare the aid that you just spoke up with the millions or billions of dollars that go towards Israel in terms of military aid, if not other aid as well.'
p1517
aS'John Donvan: Okay.'
p1518
aS"Stuart Eizenstat: The aid to the Palestinians only started fairly recently because it is only after Madrid that the PLO abandoned their charter to destroy Israel, Hamas is yet to do it and indicated a willingness to have a two state solution although they we haven't fulfilled it."
p1519
aS"So the economic aid hasn't accumulated but it is very substantial."
p1520
aS"On a per capita basis, very substantial, and it's all going for economic assistance."
p1521
aS'John Donvan: There was a, yes.'
p1522
aS'Maam, I see you in the far corner and you have a yellow pad in your hand, and if you wave it, a microphone will come to you.'
p1523
aS'Sarah Lehman: My name is Sarah Lehman (ph) and I write for the Jewish press, and I have a statement and a question directed mostly towards Roger Cohen.'
p1524
aS'John Donvan: Can you do more question than statement?'
p1525
aS'Sarah Lehman: Yes, okay.'
p1526
aS'In light of the fact that Israeli concessions over the years have not led to peace because the Palestinians have responded mostly with violence and also in light of the fact that Hamas charter has not changed its call for the destruction of the Jewish state, and the incitement that continues to go on - anti-Semitic incitement and propaganda by the Palestinians under the supposed moderate John Donvan: I need to come home with this question, I see where you are going.'
p1527
aS'Sarah Lehman: Personally as a Jew, how would you - why would advocate a severing of the special relationship with America in favor of towards Arabs or Palestinians who wish for your demise?'
p1528
aS"John Donvan: That's a question for Roger Cohen?"
p1529
aS'Sarah Lehman: Anyone.'
p1530
aS'Roger Cohen: I think I have tried to describe why - certainly, there have been Israeli attempts, very serious Israeli attempts to make peace.'
p1531
aS'But if you look at the last 20 years, peace is going to involve an exchange of land, and what has Israel continued to do over the last 20 years?'
p1532
aS'It has doubled, tripled the size of the settlements in the West Bank and this simply makes it impossible to make that exchange.'
p1533
aS"Look, what we just heard about what's happening in the West Bank shows that there is nothing congenital about a Palestinian inability to take responsibility for their lives and for their governance."
p1534
aS'Given half the chance, I think they are capable of it.'
p1535
aS'But when, if you, have you driven through the West Bank recently, madam?'
p1536
aS'Sarah Lehman: Yes.'
p1537
aS'Roger Cohen: What did you see?'
p1538
aS'I think you saw a fractured, divided Palestinian community.'
p1539
aS'Israeli garrisons on every hill, road blocks, the difficulty of families to get to the market, to get the fields, to get to their jobs and so on.'
p1540
aS'What does this say to Palestinians about the seriousness of Israeli intent to make peace?'
p1541
aS'It says these guys are not serious, and why has it that the Prime Minister Fayyad has not come back to the table.'
p1542
aS'He has not come back to the table because the Palestinians are not satisfied of the essential seriousness of Israel.'
p1543
aS'And what is enabling the government or Prime Minister Netanyahu to take this stance, it is the unconditional nature of U.S. support under the special relationship, which is why ladies and gentlemen you should vote for the proposition tonight.'
p1544
aS'John Donvan: We are coming down towards the end of the question section, so I just want to ask the panelist at this point to be slightly more concise.'
p1545
aS'We are doing a few more questions.'
p1546
aS'Itamar Rabinovich.'
p1547
aS"Itamar Rabinovich: Commenting on Roger Cohen's last comment, I think in an earlier comment, you actually provided the answers to why the Palestinians will not negotiate."
p1548
aS'Because you painted a scenario that over the next 10, 20 years, if the status quo continues, there will be one country with a Palestinian majority.'
p1549
aS'This stretch has not been lost on many Palestinians, and support for the two state solution has dwindled among the Palestinians because many of them say, lets sit back and wait and it will be all ours.'
p1550
aS'Because it will be one man, one vote with a Palestinian majority, and that is a very serious danger.'
p1551
aS"That's why there are also commonalties - even commonalities between Rashid Khalidi and I because - Roger Cohen: It's a matter of danger exist, why is Israel not being more serious about a two state solution, which is the only way to avoid a one state outcome."
p1552
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: Because the answer is - because the party I voted for lost the last election.'
p1553
aS'Roger Cohen: Well, there you go.'
p1554
aS'Thank you.'
p1555
aS'John Donvan: Rashid.'
p1556
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Palestinians negotiate.'
p1557
aS"I'm a Palestinian American."
p1558
aS'I spent three years negotiating, you were dealing with the Syrians, I was dealing with - Itamar Rabinovich: With Israelis.'
p1559
aS'Rashid Khalidi,: Yes.'
p1560
aS'With Yaken Rubenstein (ph) specifically.'
p1561
aS'And what we were facing then was an American commitment under the first Bush administration to do something if things were done, that prejudged or in some way prefigured an outcome and we came to them.'
p1562
aS'And we said, wait a minute, Israelis are closing off Jerusalem, the close of Jerusalem was just starting in this period and settlement is continuing.'
p1563
aS'They are eating the pie we are supposed to be negotiating and we got no response from the United States.'
p1564
aS'This was in 1991, went for years and years and years, Palestinians were negotiating.'
p1565
aS'Palestinians negotiated with Israel without any problem for that entire decade and got absolutely nowhere.'
p1566
aS'Now you can say the Oslo Accords, the Oslo Accords immiserated the Palestinians.'
p1567
aS'Palestinian GDP decreased over that decade from 1990 to 2000.'
p1568
aS"The Palestinians who were able to move anywhere in the occupied territories into Israel to the Golan Heights in 1990 or '91, '92 were locked into whatever you want to call them, Bantustans, ghettos whatever you want to call them by the end of that period of the Oslo Accord."
p1569
aS'So this process of settlement is not something which is just a minor issue.'
p1570
aS'It is a central issue, it is absolutely central if you expect the Palestinian negotiate, this is something that should have been stopped 20 years ago, not 2010.'
p1571
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Professor, you are historian.'
p1572
aS'I was in charge of the economic dimension of the peace process.'
p1573
aS'I can tell you your figures are totally incorrect.'
p1574
aS'Between 1997 and 2000, the territories grew at an average of 5%, unemployment was down to 8% in the West Bank and 14% in Gaza.'
p1575
aS'A 100,000 Palestinians were coming into Israel every single day to work.'
p1576
aS'It was 40% of the GDP of the territories remittances.'
p1577
aS'20,000 Arab Palestinian business people could drive in without any checkpoints.'
p1578
aS'Yes, 1997 and then what happened?'
p1579
aS'Yasser Arafat in 2000 brought the whole house of cards down on the process, refusing the offer and instigating the second intifada.'
p1580
aS"So it's very important to understand case and effect here."
p1581
aS'We were on a real process of peace, I personally went to Gaza.'
p1582
aS'I saw the Gaza industrial estate with 30 companies from all over the world creating 1200 jobs in Gaza, a second phase started.'
p1583
aS'We had Israelis visiting Romolo (ph) over the weekend.'
p1584
aS'We had 100,000 Palestinians coming into Israel every day to work.'
p1585
aS'John Donvan: Stuart, we see where you are going, but I just have a little bit more time left, woman on the balcony and just give a minute for the camera to find you.'
p1586
aS'Danielle Abraham: My name is Danielle Abraham (ph), I am at Argos - student at the Argos program of leadership and diplomacy that Herzliya in Israel.'
p1587
aS'We just arrived two days ago.'
p1588
aS'My question is about U.S. public opinion.'
p1589
aS'Because as we saw on the last Presidential debate as in all presidential debates, the one thing that both can take always (inaudible) is the special relationship with Israel and this is not the coincidence.'
p1590
aS'This is because the all studies and all polls show that the United States public supports this special relationship.'
p1591
aS"Now, - John Donvan: So what's your question?"
p1592
aS"Danielle Abraham: So my question is of course to Mr. Cohen and professor Khalidi should - isn't it a shame that this the public support of the people, isn't it a shame to American democracy that this is not factored in to this debate?"
p1593
aS'John Donvan: Well, Roger Cohen?'
p1594
aS'Roger Cohen: Thank you for that question.'
p1595
aS'It makes any adjustment in U.S. policy toward Israel such as President Obama is now trying to accomplish extremely difficult.'
p1596
aS'There is a state called Florida.'
p1597
aS"It's a vital state in the U.S. presidential election."
p1598
aS'It has a large Jewish community.'
p1599
aS'This calculation is not lost on Americas leadership.'
p1600
aS'President Obama, I understand, has been told by some Jewish congressman, if you want your health bill, step back on Israel.'
p1601
aS'So the reality is indeed that it is very hard I have heard that reliably.'
p1602
aS'The reality of the situation is that it is extremely difficult to steer a U.S. public opinion in any way toward any acceptance of an adjustment of policy towards the State of Israel.'
p1603
aS'I think it should be done in the following terms: The President should explain that the adjustments he is making are in pursuit of peace and in pursuit of the long-term peace and security of the State of Israel.'
p1604
aS'Policies up to now have failed.'
p1605
aS'Therefore, we should see a change.'
p1606
aS'John Donvan: Stuart Eizenstat?'
p1607
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: I was wondering how long it would take and who would raise the issue of quote unquote, "Untoward Jewish influence over U.S. formed policies.'
p1608
aS'" I am glad you finally (inaudible) came to it.'
p1609
aS'Roger Cohen: I didnt say untoward.'
p1610
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Now let me just say I have served in three administrations.'
p1611
aS"I didn't say all - this is a dangerous canard that 2% of the U.S. population has somehow got its hand around the neck of American foreign policy."
p1612
aS'American foreign policy towards Israel is supported by a bipartisan majority because the American public recognizes that Israel and the United States share common interest and common values.'
p1613
aS"And those are always counter balanced by oil interest, by corporate interest that have major defense interest, major business interest, that's the way policies is made in the United States, is just a clash of interest."
p1614
aS"But the notion that 2% of the U.S. population is driving a policy against where the public thinks simply belied by every survey that's been made."
p1615
aS'Roger Cohen: Nobody said that.'
p1616
aS'John Donvan: Itamar Rabinovich Itamar Rabinovich: Maybe you should elect a President from Alaska where there are no Jews.'
p1617
aS'Rashid Khalidi: You would like that.'
p1618
aS'John Donvan: There is a gentleman with the blazer and sweater.'
p1619
aS'This may be our last question.'
p1620
aS'Unidentified Participant: My name is Allen Skolnick (ph).'
p1621
aS'Israel as many of you know has 1.2 million Arabs living in Israel they are probably more mosque in Israel than or certainly than they are maybe close to synagogues in Europe.'
p1622
aS'With that background in mind the presumption that we hear all during the discussion of course this debate is that Palestinian state if it was to be would have to be essentially without any Jews.'
p1623
aS'The whole discussion is the settlements is the biggest impediment to peace, alter something out of the box, Roger Cohen, what is the Palestinian position which I think might in gender more, a better U.S. special relationship?'
p1624
aS"Why isn't built on a basis of inclusion even at the scant change of minority of Jews and establish itself on enforcing minority rights for some even for Jews and demonstrate its small character and its commitment to peace instead of having to give a constant reiteration of a new Arab country that will be one more without any Jews."
p1625
aS'John Donvan: Roger Cohen.'
p1626
aS'Roger Cohen: Thank you sir.'
p1627
aS"I'm not sure there are many Israelis who would want to go and live in the West Bank."
p1628
aS'Certainly, under the current conditions there are some who live there, I am not going to argue with this, that Israel is by far the most liberal and democratic state in the region.'
p1629
aS'It has a free press, it has a relatively independent judiciary, it has democratic system, it has remarkable achievements in technology and its economy.'
p1630
aS"It has everything except peace, and what we are talking about tonight is how the best to stay here this remarkable society toward whether it's requesting for and I don't think it's through the policy that Israel is currently pursuing or through the current banking that United States is giving for those polices that is what we are debating."
p1631
aS'Would a Palestinian state is ever comes into being should it offer ecology of opportunity for citizens of all race, religion, background, et cetera, yes, it should.'
p1632
aS'John Donvan: And that concludes around two of our debates.'
p1633
aS'And here is where we are about to hear brief closing statements from each of the debaters in turn.'
p1634
aS"Those statements will be two minutes each and it's their last chance to change your mind and from the live audience beforehand we knew where you stood before the debate actually begin on our motion the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel."
p1635
aS'We asked you to vote before the debate where you stood and at that point 33% of you were for the motion and 42% were against and 25% remained undecided, you will be asked to vote once again and pick the winner in just a few minutes from now.'
p1636
aS'But first we are going onto round three closing statements and speaking first against the motion.'
p1637
aS'The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p1638
aS'Stuart Eizenstat former ambassador to the European Union under Bill Clinton and Chief Domestic Policy Advisor to Jimmy Carter.'
p1639
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Number one, Israel is not a recruitment tool for terrorism as Roger said, it is absolutely not.'
p1640
aS'They recruit on the basis of hatred toward the west and towards secular pro- western Arab states.'
p1641
aS'Number two, Israel has shown when there is a peace partner Satad Egypt.'
p1642
aS'King Hussein and George that they will negotiate that they will make concessions and peace will come when the Palestinian leadership demonstrates a commitment like Arafat, like Hussein did and like Sadat did.'
p1643
aS"Third, let's talk about concrete benefits."
p1644
aS'Israel does not just act on its own interest.'
p1645
aS'If for example in the first Gulf War 1991 agreed with President George H.W.'
p1646
aS"Bush not to retaliate against the barrage of Saddam Hussein's scud missiles on Tel Aviv, staying in shelters so that President Bush could keep his coalition together in the first Gulf of war."
p1647
aS'Second, Israel gets concrete benefits by supporting the U.S. in terms of anti nuclear proliferation in the region destroying the nuclear reactor of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 1981, and more recently Syrias budding nuclear facility supported by North Korea and standing shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. on the Iranian nuclear arms ambitions, and allowing the U.S. to take the lead on sanctions.'
p1648
aS'Israel shares real time intelligence.'
p1649
aS'I have seen it with the U.S. on terrorism and to the U.S. not simply at itself on rends nuclear capabilities.'
p1650
aS'General Keegan, the Former Head of Air Force Intelligence said, "I could not have obtained the same intelligence I receive from Israel if there were five CIAs.'
p1651
aS'Israel also John Donvan: Stuart, your time is up, but I will give you one more sentence to summarize.'
p1652
aS'Stuart Eizenstat: Thank you.'
p1653
aS"In terms of the economy itself which we haven't talked about."
p1654

aS'Summarizing for the motion, the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p1657
aS'Roger Cohen, a columnist and former foreign correspondent and foreign editor for the New York Times.'
p1658
aS'Roger Cohen: Ladies and gentlemen, if you strip away all the rhetoric of the opposing team.'
p1659
aS'In the end, what are they are arguing for?'
p1660
aS'They are arguing for more of the same.'
p1661
aS'If you think more of the same is fine, if you think the growing hatreds, antagonism, estrangement in the area is just fine, then you should vote against the resolution and not for it, as we are arguing.'
p1662
aS"I don't believe that's the case, I believe what's going on is unhealthy and the United States by stepping back would put pressure on Israel to adjust its policies and open new avenues to the new Middle East of which President Obama has spoken."
p1663
aS'In the end, you have to put your backbone where your wish bone is, and what does America wish for?'
p1664
aS'Two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.'
p1665
aS'And as we have described, uncritical U.S. support of Israel in policies that undermine the possibility of two states is just a recipe for further failure.'
p1666
aS'What does America also wish for under President Obama?'
p1667
aS'He wants a new relationship with the Islamic world.'
p1668
aS'This will require more than just words and pretty speeches.'
p1669
aS'It will require a new balance in the U.S. approach to the region a new readiness to speak to enemies, only then will we move forward.'
p1670
aS'And if you think as Stu Eizenstat just suggested that if the United States succeeded in establishing a new and more harmonious relationship with the Islamic world this would have no effect whatsoever on the terrorist threat that the United States faces.'
p1671
aS'Believe me, I think you are wrong.'
p1672
aS'I would like to conclude with the words of Mahmoud Darwish, the great Palestinian poet who died last year and he wrote in his poem State of Siege, me or him that how war starts but it ends in awkward stances, me and him.'
p1673
aS"It's time for American policy to reflect better the him and the me of the Middle East."
p1674
aS'For all sorts of reasons this will not be easy, which is why ladies and gentlemen, you would help in this difficult adjustment by being courageous and voting for the proposition tonight.'
p1675
aS'John Donvan: Thank you Roger Cohen.'
p1676
aS"On a little bit of a course of these two statements turning into 2 minutes and 24 seconds, so I'm going to give that to everybody."
p1677
aS'Our motion is U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel and summarizing his position against the motion.'
p1678
aS'Itamar Rabinovich, former Israeli Ambassador to the United States and chief negotiator with Syria in the mid-1990s.'
p1679
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: I want to look at the vision, the dream.'
p1680
aS"The President of United States on Air Force One, landing at an airport in Gaza wouldn't that be a great moment."
p1681
aS'It already happened, Bill Clinton landed with Air Force One at an Air Force in Gaza in the late 1990s.'
p1682
aS'There was an efforts by our opponent to describe a unilinear Israeli undermining of any effort to make peace between Israel and Palestinians to detriment of the region of the United States.'
p1683
aS'But actually during the last 20 years and 30 years almost 40 years of the peace process that began in 1973 what kept the peace process going, it was American Israeli cooporation.'
p1684
aS'There were some very high moments in this, the peace with Egypt, peace with Jordan.'
p1685
aS"First Israeli visit to countries in the Gulf and in the North Africa and yes, Clinton landing in the Gaza strip, at an airport when it seemed that the Palestinian are underway to state of an independence before everything turned sour because of the change of mind of Yasser Arafat's conduct that led to the disastrous consequences of the last decade 2000 to 2010."
p1686
aS'Second, I think we had a problem, our debate was diverted tonight from debate on the U.S. Israeli special relationship to a debate on the Palestine problem, a very worthy subject, but not exactly that the focus of the issue.'
p1687
aS'The issue is here is the Middle East a crucial part of the world, here is an Arab world 330 million people almost half a billion in decade or two.'
p1688
aS'This is not all subjected to the Palestinian issue.'
p1689
aS'There are many other issues.'
p1690
aS'Iran was barely mentioned tonight.'
p1691
aS'Now I tell you, you go to somebody who lives in Kuwait, or somebody who lives in Cairo, or somebody who lives in Oman and asking what is uppermost in your mind.'
p1692
aS'And he would say, Iran.'
p1693
aS'The Iranian threat, the Iranian bomb, the Iranian expansionism.'
p1694
aS'And what do you expect.'
p1695
aS'I expect the United States to protect me from Iran.'
p1696
aS'John Donvan: Thank you.'
p1697
aS'Itamar Rabinovich: Iran, the United States can do that John Donvan: Thank you.'
p1698
aS'Our motion is the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.'
p1699
aS'Our final speaker to summaries his position for the motion Rashid Khalidi professor at Columbia University and former advisor to the Palestinian delegation for Arab Israeli peace negotiations.'
p1700
aS'Rashid Khalidi: Thank you.'
p1701
aS'You should vote for this proposition because it would end our record of failure in Palestinian Israeli peace making.'
p1702
aS'And counter to the views of what you just heard this is centrally important in the Middle East.'
p1703
aS'You should vote for this proposition because it would stop the United States for enabling Israel in its worst habits of occupation and settlement, things that harm United States harm of course Palestinians but also harm Israel.'
p1704
aS'Most importantly, you should vote for the proposition because it would help to bring peace and would be in the U.S. national interest.'
p1705
aS"I've said that if you do not vote for this proposition you are voting for the status quo."
p1706
aS'More process no peace.'
p1707
aS'Now that is not the status quo that is stable, that is a status quo it is evolving, I would suggest in a fashion not favorable to I think most of the interests that most of us share.'
p1708
aS'Let me read quote briefly, as long as in this territory west of the Jordon there is only one political entity called Israel.'
p1709
aS'It is going to be either non Jewish or non democratic.'
p1710
aS'Speaker continued if this block of millions of Palestinians cannot vote this will become an apartheid state.'
p1711
aS'This was not some anti-Semitism; this is not some Israel passer; this is Defense Minister of State of Israel, Ehud Barak speaking on the 3rd of February at Herzliya.'
p1712
aS'That is status quo that is where it is going.'
p1713
aS'It is in - ultimately a decision for the Israelis to take where they want to go, but we enable this, that is why you should vote for this proposition.'
p1714
aS'And let me conclude by saying something about Iran.'
p1715
aS'If Israel attacks Iran, in a situation where this special relation is unmodified, imagine if you will the impact on U.S. interests, on U.S. troops in Iraq, on the U.S. position in the Gulf and the Gulf itself.'
p1716
aS'Now if this relationship remains unchanged, if United States is perceived as the hand maiden, the guardian, the enabler, of everything that Israel does we will be responsible when and if that catastrophic things happens.'
p1717
aS'If Iran is a problem for the region not just for Israel, but it is not a problem to be resolved in the way that a lot of Israelis are pushing us to resolve it.'
p1718
aS'That is why among many other reasons you should vote for the proposition.'
p1719
aS'John Donvan: Thank you Rashid Khalidi.'
p1720
aS"And that concludes our closing statements and now it's time to learn which side you feel argued best, we are going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat."
p1721
aS'Our motion is that U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel if you agree with the motion now, push number 1, if you disagree, push number 2.'
p1722
aS'If you remain undecided, push number 3.'
p1723
aS'Or if you became undecided push number 3.'
p1724
aS'And if you - if somebody is having some trouble, if you push the wrong button just push it, the one you want to correct with and it will lock it.'
p1725
aS'All right, so we are very close to getting the results which I think we are locking out and are being tabulated at the moment.'
p1726
aS'So, before I get to those, first of all I want to thank our panelist for coming here in the spirit of listening as well as debating.'
p1727
aS"I also want to thank the people in the audience who asked questions because there wasn't a clunker among them."
p1728
aS'Thank you all for your questions as well.'
p1729
aS'I thought they are pretty good.'
p1730
aS'Some future announcements.'

p1735
aS"The new motion for that debate is going to be this, Obama's foreign policy is gift to America's enemies."
p1736
aS'With the Obama presidency now entering its second year, the administrations foreign policy taking shape and voices of many political opponents and even some supporters beginning to challenge his decisions we felt the time was right for a thoughtful debate on this topic.'
p1737
aS'And actually debaters are booked now and we will announce soon.'

p1742
aS"Okay, now it's all in, and we have the final results remember the team the changes the most minds is declared our winner and here it is, - I have an empty page."
p1743
aS'I picked up the wrong one.'
