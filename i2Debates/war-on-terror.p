S'Thank you very much, and welcome to the first debate of our fall season.'
p32
aS"We're excited to be back and pleased to see such a nice turnout."
p33
aS'This crowd was not terrorized by the weather.'
p34
aS"This is our 51st debate, but it's our first with Slate as our media partner and our first for our new relationship with PBS and WNET as our television outlet."
p35
aS"We're delighted to have such first class partners, joining our effort to improve the quality of our public discourse."
p36
aS'So to our resolution tonight, "It\'s time to end the War on Terror.'
p37
aS'" Ideologically, the appeal of terrorism as a way to redress grievances has been undermined.'
p38
aS'The Arab Spring has accomplished far more through largely peaceful means than Al-Qaeda ever accomplished through violence.'
p39
aS'Tactically, the balance has shifted.'
p40
aS'Osama bin Laden was uniquely charismatic and inspirational, with large financial resources.'
p41
aS"Now he's dead as are most of his lieutenants."
p42
aS"Al-Qaeda's leadership is fractured; its communications primitive; its financing highly constrained; and its operational capabilities severely limited."
p43
aS'We achieved this result by expending enormous resources for intelligence surveillance, drone attacks and brilliantly coordinated raids, but the Al-Qaeda war was never going to be ended by a peace treaty.'
p44
aS"History, however, has moved on; and it's time for us to move on as well."
p45
aS'The War on Terror no longer makes sense as an organizing principle for U.S. policy.'
p46
aS"But what's the counter argument to all of this?"
p47
aS'It is that we cannot simply declare victory and shift our concerns elsewhere.'
p48
aS'Terrorist attacks are still occurring with depressing frequency in Iraq and Afghanistan.'
p49
aS"Pakistan's duplicity has been exposed, but it remains a nuclear power with destabilizing, radical Islamic elements."
p50
aS'Suicide bombers are still an asymmetric threat and a tactic to be reckoned with.'
p51
aS"America's hated as much as ever by Islamic jihadists who certainly have the desire to inflict mass casualties on us through whatever means they can obtain."
p52
aS"This is not the time to bask in the glow of victory but rather the time to maintain the vigilance that has kept us safe during the decade we're about to mark this week."
p53
aS'But which is the better argument?'
p54
aS"It's up to you to decide; and to help you make that decision, we've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts."
p55
aS"Before I turn the evening over to them and to our moderator John Donvan, I'd like to invite Jacob Weisberg, editor and chief of the Slate Group to say a word."

p145
aS'So all four of these people know what they are talking about, and yet they disagree on calling an end to the War on Terror.'
p146
aS"All of them are dedicated to winning you over to their point of view here in our live audience because you, our live audience, are the judges in this debate, and that's what this is."

aS"First of all, Juliette and I wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service that General Hayden has done and also Richard Falkenrath's more than a decade of public service."
p228
aS"I also wanted to acknowledge Juliette Kayyem's decade and a half of public service where she became the highest ranking Arab-American in the Obama administration, the assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security."
p229
aS"She also had three kids that she raised at the same time, putting home into Homeland Security in a meaningful sense -- -- and is one of the world's leading experts on the question of homeland security."
p230
aS"My own connection to the story came when the Trade Center was bombed for the first time in '93."
p231
aS'I traveled to Afghanistan, produced a documentary about the threat we face from Afghanistan and then, of course, interviewed bin Laden.'
p232
aS"I've written three books on the subject of Al-Qaeda."
p233
aS"I've embedded with our troops on multiple occasions in Iraq and Afghanistan."
p234
aS'From a self-interested point of view, I have every incentive to say the threat that Al-Qaeda and terrorism poses to us remains very serious.'
p235
aS"And it merits on open-ended conflict against them; but in good conscience, I simply can't make that argument."
p236
aS'War is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today.'
p237
aS'Our singular focus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems.'
p238
aS'Our crumbling infrastructure, our decaying schools, deeply serious economic problems.'
p239
aS'Another national security problem is managing the future of the Arab Spring, for instance; preventing nuclear war between Pakistan and India; preventing a nuclear war between North Korea and South Korea; managing the rise of China which, while weve been distracted by the War on Terror, has quietly expanded its influence in Africa and in Southeast Asia.'
p240
aS"Our opponents want to prolong the War on Terror, an open-ended conflict against a tactic that is already America's longest war."
p241
aS"We're saying it's time for war to end."
p242
aS'President Obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflict against the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against Al-Qaeda and its allies, which both names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict.'
p243
aS"When we say it's time for the War on Terror to end, we don't mean we should precipitously pull out of Afghanistan, but we do mean that it's time to stop conceiving our principle national security goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting, for instance, our own economic house in order will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we'll inevitably face at some point in the future."
p244
aS'The War on Terror, as everybody in the audience knows, has caused the American public at least a trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and, of course, got us into the catastrophic Iraq War; further trillions on our -- both our Intelligence and Homeland National Security apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinary renditions.'
p245
aS"And you'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away from the War on Terror and what it entails, not because there was no threat."
p246
aS"We're not claiming that at all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must -- we as well."
p247
aS"Key American National Security officials now say that Al-Qaeda's on its last leg."
p248
aS"John Brennan, who, of course, is President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said that just last week."
p249
aS'Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al-Qaeda is within sight.'
p250
aS'General David Petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently.'
p251
aS'None of these gentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism.'
p252
aS'So is this premature triumphalism the claim that Al-Qaeda is on its last legs?'
p253
aS'Well, I think the claim is well-justified.'
p254
aS"I mean, the leadership of Al-Qaeda's been completely decimated in the campaign of drone attacks."
p255
aS"The most dangerous job in the world right now has been Al-Qaeda's number two."
p256
aS"There have been about 20 of them since 2008, including most recently, the group's number two out here, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed just a few weeks -- just about a week ago."
p257
aS"Al-Qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the West since the 7/7 attacks in London six years ago."
p258
aS"Al-Qaeda hasn't killed a single American in the United States since 9/11."
p259
aS"And think about the real wars we've really confronted."
p260
aS'The Civil War threatened to tear this country apart.'
p261
aS"World War II, we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tens of millions, and if the Cold War had ended with a bang instead of whimper, we'd all be not in this debate because we'd all be dead."
p262
aS'Those are serious threats.'
p263
aS"The War on Terror -- the threat we faced from Al-Qaeda doesn't come close; and in fact, only 17 Americans have died as a result of Al-Qaeda's ideological ideas in this country, 13 of them, of course, at Fort Hood and others in other places."
p264
aS"More Americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbers around 300, and we don't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs; so we shouldn't have an unreasonable fear of Al-Qaeda."
p265
aS"And by terrorism , we're terrified, by the way, of course, and we're doing the job of the terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in."
p266
aS"And everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actually dramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks; and that's in part because Al-Qaeda and bin Laden have been losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world for years."
p267
aS'Their founder and leader was killed, as you know, in Abbottabad on the evening of May 1st.'
p268
aS"In the Arab Spring, there's not a single revolutionary who's carrying a single picture of Osama bin laden."
p269
aS"Bin Laden's ideas have been completely absent from the Arab Spring."
p270
aS"There hasn't been a single flag burning in the Arab Spring of an American flag or even an Israeli flag; so bin Laden's foot soldiers, ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenon in the Arab world."
p271
aS"Our opponents may claim that we're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction."
p272
aS'This claim, of course, follows simply the disastrous war in Iraq; and in fact, the 188 jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11, not a single one of them involved chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.'
p273

p274
aS"I would submit to you in the audience, if the death of the founder and leader of Al-Qaeda isn't the point where we can say the War on Terror is over and then add to that the destruction of almost its entire top leadership, its absence in the revolutions across the Middle East, its inability to mount any kind of attack on the United States for a decade isn't the point to end the War on Terror, when will that point be?"

S"Thank you.First of all, Juliette and I wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service [[applause]] that General Hayden has done and also Richard Falkenrath's more than a decade of publicservice.I also wanted to acknowledge Juliette Kayyem's decade and a half of public service where shebecame the highest ranking Arab-American in the Obama administration, the assistant secretaryto the Department of Homeland Security."
p286
aS"She also had three kids that she raised at the sametime, putting home into Homeland Security in a meaningful sense ---- and is one of the world's leading experts on the question of homeland security."
p287
aS"My own [[laughter]] connection to the story came when the Trade Center was bombed for the first time in '93."
p288
aS"Itraveled to Afghanistan, produced a documentary about the threat we face from Afghanistanand then, of course, interviewed bin Laden.I've written three books on the subject of Al-Qaeda."
p289
aS"I've embedded with our troops on multipleoccasions in Iraq and Afghanistan.From a self-interested point of view, I have every incentive to say the threat that Al-Qaeda andterrorism poses to us remains very serious."
p290
aS"And it merits on open-ended conflict against them;but in good conscience, I simply can't make that argument.War is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today."
p291
aS'Our singularfocus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems.'
p292
aS"Our crumbling infrastructure, ourdecaying schools, deeply serious economic problems.Another national security problem is managing the future of the Arab Spring, for instance;preventing nuclear war between Pakistan and India; preventing a nuclear war between NorthKorea and South Korea; managing the rise of China which, while weve been distracted by theWar on Terror, has quietly expanded its influence in Africa and in Southeast Asia.Our opponents want to prolong the War on Terror, an open-ended conflict against a tactic thatis already America's longest war."
p293
aS"We're saying it's time for war to end.President Obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflictagainst the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against Al-Qaeda and its allies, whichboth names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict.When we say it's time for the War on Terror to end, we don't mean we should precipitously pullout of Afghanistan, but we do mean that it's time to stop conceiving our principle nationalsecurity goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting, for instance, our own economic house inorder will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we'll inevitably face at some point inthe future.The War on Terror, as everybody in the audience knows, has caused the American public at leasta trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and, of course, got us into thecatastrophic Iraq War; further trillions on our -- both our Intelligence and Homeland NationalSecurity apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinaryrenditions.And you'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away fromthe War on Terror and what it entails, not because there was no threat."
p294
aS"We're not claiming thatat all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must -- we as well.Key American National Security officials now say that Al-Qaeda's on its last leg."
p295
aS"John Brennan,who, of course, is President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said that just last week.Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al-Qaeda is within sight.General David Petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently."
p296
aS'None of thesegentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism.'
p297
aS'So is this prematuretriumphalism the claim that Al-Qaeda is on its last legs?'
p298
aS'Well, I think the claim is well-justified.'
p299
aS"Imean, the leadership of Al-Qaeda's been completely decimated in the campaign of droneattacks.The most dangerous job in the world right now has been Al-Qaeda's number two."
p300
aS"There havebeen about 20 of them since 2008, including most recently, the group's number two out here,Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed just a few weeks -- just about a week ago.Al-Qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the West since the 7/7 attacks in London sixyears ago."
p301
aS"Al-Qaeda hasn't killed a single American in the United States since 9/11.And think about the real wars we've really confronted."
p302
aS'The Civil War threatened to tear thiscountry apart.'
p303
aS"World War II, we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tensof millions, and if the Cold War had ended with a bang instead of whimper, we'd all be not inthis debate because we'd all be dead.Those are serious threats.The War on Terror -- the threat we faced from Al-Qaeda doesn't come close; and in fact, only 17Americans have died as a result of Al-Qaeda's ideological ideas in this country, 13 of them, ofcourse, at Fort Hood and others in other places.More Americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbersaround 300, and we don't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs; so we shouldn't have anunreasonable fear of Al-Qaeda.And by terrorism , we're terrified, by the way, of course, and we're doing the job of the [[laughter]] terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in.And everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actuallydramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks; and that's in part because Al-Qaedaand bin Laden have been losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world for years.Their founder and leader was killed, as you know, in Abbottabad on the evening of May 1st."
p304
aS"Inthe Arab Spring, there's not a single revolutionary who's carrying a single picture of Osama binladen.Bin Laden's ideas have been completely absent from the Arab Spring."
p305
aS"There hasn't been a singleflag burning in the Arab Spring of an American flag or even an Israeli flag; so bin Laden's footsoldiers, ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenonin the Arab world.Our opponents may claim that we're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of massdestruction."
p306
aS"This claim, of course, follows simply the disastrous war in Iraq; and in fact, the 188jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11, not a single one of them involved chemical,biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.We will no doubt hear from our opponents that to argue the War on Terrorism is overly soft orunrealistic or weak -- and they make claim that, at some point, we will decide we no longer needto define it as a War on Terror, but we aren't there yet.I would submit to you in the audience, if the death of the founder and leader of Al-Qaeda isn'tthe point where we can say the War on Terror is over and then add to that the destruction ofalmost its entire top leadership, its absence in the revolutions across the Middle East, itsinability to mount any kind of attack on the United States for a decade isn't the point to end theWar on Terror, when will that point be?We say it's now."

p384
aS'When I -- when I talk to audiences about the War on Terror, I generally refer to a speech I gave at the German Embassy in the spring of 2007.'
p385
aS'The Germans were in the chair of the European Union, and the German ambassador would have the ambassadors to the United States from the European Union over for lunch about every two weeks and would have an American come in to kind of be the lunchtime entertainment, and it was my turn.'
p386

p387
aS'About page two or three of that speech, I wanted to make very clear to my audience what I thought, what my agency thought and what I think my nation thought.'
p388
aS'And I gave them four sentences.'
p389
aS'"We believe we are a nation at war.'
p390
aS'" "We are at war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates" -- the description that Peter just gave and that President Obama emphasized that reflected what we were thinking several years earlier.'
p391
aS'"A nation at war"; "At war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates"; "This war is global in scope"; and "We can only fulfill our moral and ethical responsibilities to you, the citizens of this republic, by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be.'
p392
aS'" George Tenet was the DCI, the Director of Central Intelligence.'
p393
aS'In 1999, sent a note out to all of us in the Intelligence community, saying "We\'re at war with Al-Qaeda.'
p394
aS'" And George was but America wasn\'t.'
p395
aS'America went to war with Al-Qaeda shortly after the attacks on September 11, 2001.'
p396
aS'Two successive American presidents have defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda.'
p397
aS'The American Congress has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda; and the American court system, only a few blocks from here, has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda when a defendant, attempting to claim he had been denied his right to a speedy trial because he had been in detention for several years, his claim was rejected by the court, saying we, as a nation at war, had a right to detain him as a combatant.'
p398
aS"Now, we could discuss troop levels in Iraq, the rate of withdrawal from Afghanistan, a whole bunch of other details about this war, but that's not the point I think Rich and I want to make."
p399
aS'The point we want to make is the legal construct -- the legal belief that we are a nation at war; that we are a nation in conflict; and we have a right, because we are in that status, to use the legal tools and the legal authorities that a nation at war is allowed to use.'
p400
aS"What it is we're supporting is to keep all available tools on the table -- to keep a menu of options from law enforcement, diplomacy, or to arm conflict in order to keep you safe."
p401
aS'I would also add -- and I really want to emphasis this -- that conceiving yourself at war in addition to whatever it is you might do in a law enforcement channel is not somehow lawless.'
p402
aS'It is perfectly lawful.'
p403
aS'It is a different lawful approach than a law enforcement approach, but it is consistent with the laws of armed conflict that we have a right to resort to in order to defend ourselves.'
p404
aS'I assume everyone here is happy that Osama bin Laden was killed on the morning of the second of May in Pakistan.'
p405
aS'Let me give you -- thank you.'
p406
aS'Let me give you a slightly different description of that event.'
p407
aS'A heavily armed agent of the United States government was in a room with an unarmed man who was under indictment in the United States judicial system and was offering no significant resistance to the heavily armed agent of the United States government, and that heavily armed agent of the United States government killed him.'
p408
aS'If you do not think we are at war, there are some very troubling definitions that you might want to attach to that act.'
p409
aS"That's the kind of authority we have perfectly lawful -- and no way am I suggesting anyone acted inappropriately."
p410
aS'We acted perfectly lawfully because we are a nation at war and generally recognized as such.'
p411
aS"You don't want to take those tools off the table while there are terrorists out there."
p412
aS'If you let this tool go, you will be less safe.'
p413
aS'Okay.'
p414
aS"If you look at the scope of our constitutional system, the law enforcement approach is designed, if you look at the constitution, the Bill of Rights and the American statutory law, the law enforcement approach is designed to make the government weak because we don't want the government arbitrarily taking away your liberties."
p415
aS"On the other hand, if you look at those sections of the Constitution that deal with armed conflict, they're designed to make the government strong so that it can protect you."
p416
aS"You don't want to take that tool off the table."
p417
aS'And quite perversely, if you take that tool off the table, you may actually threaten your own civil liberties.'
p418
aS'Bear with me.'
p419
aS"There's a tight connection here."
p420
aS'If the options of a nation at war are taken away from your tool kit, you must then rely on the options offered by law enforcement.'
p421
aS'If you recall the events in -- on Christmas day a year or two ago, Detroit, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the "Underwear Bomber" -- and he was Mirandized after about 50 minutes of interrogation, and I think everyone recognized that was probably a mistake.'
p422
aS'We should have interrogated him further.'
p423
aS'We had the attorney general talking to the American Congress about legislation that would make Miranda more malleable so that we could interrogate these kinds of people longer in our law enforcement approach.'
p424
aS"I don't want to make Miranda more malleable."

p426
aS'Defends you.'

p547
aS'We will debate with passion here but with the full acknowledgement that many of you suffered tremendously.'
p548
aS"The proposition I'm arguing for tonight is the War on Terror is over."
p549
aS'That can mean a lot of things, obviously.'
p550
aS'For me, it means one thing.'
p551
aS'A certain mind-set came to be known as the "War on Terror," and that mind-set, thankfully, is over.'
p552
aS'To explain what I mean, I want to tell you a story.'
p553
aS'I did reenter government in 2006 when Governor Deval Patrick became governor of Massachusetts; and one of my duties was to oversee the Massachusetts National Guard.'
p554
aS'I inherited a program that had been established on September 12 which was to put National Guard members on the roadways, leading up to our only nuclear facility, Pilgrim facility, and it was understandable in those days, you wanted to show greater force protection.'
p555
aS'More than five years later, they were still there, the National Guard members.'
p556
aS'Despite the tremendous work being done to counter the terrorist threat and despite no evidence that terrorists would seek to enter by road a heavily fortified facility, nobody involved with intricacies of that security thought that they were still necessary, but no one really knew how to pivot.'
p557
aS"It's very hard to pivot."
p558
aS'And the political military and public input had to be aligned.'
p559
aS'It took us awhile, but eventually we did move on, and I tell that story not as evidence that the terrorist threat is over, not at all.'
p560
aS'I tell it to say that there were other procedures that we then put in place, more aggressive surveillance, sharing better surveillance of the streets, better communications between the nuclear facility owners and the local first responders that we instituted instead of the 19 National Guard members rotating 24/7.'
p561
aS'I tell this story to remind you that 10 years is a long time.'
p562
aS'It is a long time to fight any war but one particularly where the enemy has changed so dramatically.'
p563
aS'And over that time, there had been a whole range of shifts in every jurisdiction in the federal government that had been similar to the one I just described.'
p564
aS'So to just call the ongoing efforts to dismantle, kill and disrupt Al-Qaeda and its affiliates a continuity or continuation of The War on Terror -- capital T, capital W, capital T -- is to treat the United States and the government apparatus established since 9/11 as frozen in time.'
p565
aS'It assumes that there has been no learning, no growth, no perspectives achieved, no recognition of mistakes made, no priority shifts, no advancements in our abilities and capabilities.'
p566
aS'It assumes that time had stood still for us.'
p567
aS'In many respects this debate actually is a few years too late.'
p568
aS'The War on Terror, as it became known, was an entire government ideology, based on the notion that Islamic terrorism represented a unified and operationally centralized threat to manning a predominantly military response with the President as commander in chief who could use any means necessary.'
p569
aS"Nobody, especially people who have served in National Security, denied that there is still a terrorist threat, and the U.S. Government, under any administration, to pick up on General Hayden's point, is going to have a variety of tools to use to combat that threat, including military force."
p570
aS'Nobody needs to make apologies for that, neither the left nor the right.'
p571
aS'The authorization for the use of military force passed immediately after 9/11, gave the President and the future ones the legal authorization to fight Al-Qaeda with force.'
p572
aS'It is still the law today, and it is still good law; but the fact that the government continues to use many of these same counterterrorism strategies, including killing bin Laden, of course, does not mean that the War on Terror and all that it entailed remain because we should go through the list -- the enhanced interrogation, the dark side, the with us or against us, the indiscriminate interviewing a particular Arab and Muslim communities, the registration of Arab immigrants, military tribunals that adhere to standards unrecognized in military law, the color code alerts, the breathless press conferences, the rejection of the law of wars, the treating of the Geneva Conventions as quaint, secret wiretapping and violation of established law, the disdain for the judiciary -- those were also part of that war.'
p573
aS'And thankfully, they are over, and they began to be over during the Bush administration and the continuation in this administration.'
p574
aS'It has not been more of the same, and that is good because we got better.'
p575
aS'Over these 10 years during both Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. Security apparatus became more focused and sophisticated.'
p576
aS'It was because the threat had changed.'
p577
aS'It was more decentralized and disparate, and we have adapted to that, certainly, by using military tactics to kill Al-Qaeda affiliates worldwide, but we have also become more focused, measuring success by effectiveness over shear activity.'
p578
aS'And nowhere is this more true than in Homeland Security.'
p579
aS'Unlike war, Homeland Security is very bottom up.'

p692
aS'And this is no exception to that rule.'
p693
aS'The War on Terror is a very open-ended concept, and it can be construed in many different ways.'
p694
aS"And Peter and Juliette are -- construe it in a way that really isn't that surprising, but they were very candid about it, frankly, which is they'd like it to be defined as a certain mind-set that we experienced some point in the past that we no longer should have today."
p695
aS"And I find, if I were probably -- if I was on their side of the proposition, I'd argue it the same way because this is a tough one to argue if you argue it the way Mike and I think it should be argued which, in fact, Juliette agrees with, which is you need to make this an operational proposition."

p697
aS"It's not just some squishy mind-set and set of feelings."
p698
aS"It's actually something practical."
p699
aS'And here, in fact, it is something practical.'
p700
aS'War on Terror -- war is a legal state, as Mike said.'
p701
aS'It exists in law.'
p702
aS'It is decreed by Congress and, in fact, they did decree it in this case with the authorization for the use of military force, passed by Congress on Sept. 14, signed by President Bush on Sept. 18, and still in force today.'
p703
aS'And the way I understand this proposition that we\'re voting on here, is essentially -- "Should we repeal or modify this in some way or another?'
p704
aS'" And Mike and I say, "No, we shouldn\'t.'
p705
aS'This should still stand.'
p706
aS'" Juliette also agrees with us.'
p707
aS'She thinks it should stand too.'
p708
aS"I'm not sure where Peter is."
p709
aS"But it's worth noting exactly what is says because this is what it means to be in a War on Terror."
p710
aS'It means to have this as your law of the land.'
p711
aS'It says that the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11th or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any further acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.'
p712
aS"Now, our position is quite simple: it's that this should stay the law of the land."
p713
aS"This should be the law in the United States, because, if it's not, then something Peter said is no longer the case: having the number two job in al-Qaeda is no longer the most dangerous job in the world."
p714
aS'It is today.'
p715
aS"And he's still there."
p716
aS"The number two in al-Qaeda -- it's much, much diminished, decimated probably isn't too strong a word for al-Qaeda."
p717
aS"But the number two officer in al- Qaeda on 9/11, Ayman al-Zawahiri, a shadow of the man bin Laden was, he's still alive."
p718
aS"He's in Pakistan."
p719
aS"But for this provision of law, we can't use military force unilaterally against him."
p720
aS"This is what makes such action lawful, and without this, the alternative is to go arrest him, mirandize him, bring him back to the court, which is an option, which frankly I don't believe should be taken off the table, either."
p721
aS'Probably not what we will end up pursuing in his case.'
p722
aS'But it simply makes no sense.'
p723
aS'It makes no sense to say you should repeal this.'
p724
aS"So that's my sort of first big point to you, is this is the law of the land."
p725
aS"The war on Terror is a legal state that gives us opportunities to do things under the code of law, not extra-legally, so, if that commando team does go in and kill someone, it's not murder."
p726
aS'It is, in fact, an act of war.'
p727
aS'Blessed by both branches of government -- the judiciary -- the executive and the legislative -- and without this, illegal.'
p728
aS"So, we don't want that."
p729
aS'And this strikes me as, clearly, sensible to continue.'
p730
aS'Now, should it continue indefinitely?'
p731
aS'Who knows?'
p732
aS"I'm not prepared to say exactly when it should stop."
p733
aS'But right now, today, when we know, some of the perpetrators of 9/11 are still at liberty, presumably in Pakistan.'
p734
aS'It really makes no sense whatsoever to repeal this.'
p735
aS"Now, Juliette and Peter would have us think instead about the proposition in a different way, and say, It's about a mindset."
p736
aS"It's about that terrible state when John referred to when neighbors would look at a Senior White House Official's face to see how it was when he came home from work."
p737
aS"Those days are happily over, and hopefully they'll never come back."
p738
aS"That's really not the proposition here."
p739
aS"Yes, there were lots of that we're -- if we want to have another proposition which was, did President Bush overdo it in the first four years after 9/11, that's a whole different debate."
p740
aS'And maybe, they will prevail on that one.'
p741
aS"We're debating a different proposition here."
p742
aS'This is not about whether we think President Bush got it just right in the first couple of years after 9/11 or not.'
p743
aS'This is also not really a partisan issue.'
p744
aS'And yeah, I worked for Bush.'
p745
aS'But I also worked for Mike Bloomberg.'
p746
aS'He--who knows what he is.'
p747
aS"I mean, he was a -- -- now he's independent."
p748
aS'Then he was a Republican.'
p749
aS'At one point, he was a Democrat.'
p750
aS'This is not really a partisan thing.'
p751
aS'But Peter made an interesting point.'
p752
aS'He said President Obama has more correctly and more precisely characterized the continued offensive action against Al- Qaeda and its affiliates.'
p753
aS"And he's absolutely right, that the president -- President Obama's rhetoric is very different from President Bush's."
p754
aS'They talked about it very differently.'
p755
aS'But the practice -- the nitty-gritty of what happens in counter-terrorism internationally, operationally, from the last four years of the Bush administration to today, in 9/11 -- not only is it fundamentally unchanged.'
p756
aS'Obama is tougher.'
p757
aS'He is harsher.'
p758
aS'He is sharper.'
p759
aS"I'll give you just one example."
p760
aS'I understand -- Mike probably knows this -- I just hear it from the news.'
p761
aS'There is a list of individuals who may be targeted, by name, individually, for lethal air strikes.'
p762

p787
aS"We've known each other for a long time.Debates like this often turn on trying to convince the audience, the voters, of a definition; and ifyou get them thinking about a proposition defined your way, it's clear which side should prevail,and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined the other way, it's clear which sideshould prevail."
p788
aS'And this is no exception to that rule.The War on Terror is a very open-ended concept, and it can be construed in many differentways.'
p789
aS"And Peter and Juliette are -- construe it in a way that really isn't that surprising, but theywere very candid about it, frankly, which is they'd like it to be defined as a certain mind-set thatwe experienced some point in the past that we no longer should have today.And I find, if I were probably -- if I was on their side of the proposition, I'd argue it the same waybecause this is a tough one to argue if you argue it the way Mike and I think it should be arguedwhich, in fact, Juliette agrees with, which is you need to make this an operational proposition.You need to define it in some very precise way so there's something really to weigh in on."
p790
aS"It'snot just some squishy mind-set and set of feelings."
p791
aS"It's actually something practical."
p792
aS'And here,in fact, it is something practical.War on Terror -- war is a legal state, as Mike said.'
p793
aS'It exists in law.'
p794
aS'It is decreed by Congress and,in fact, they did decree it in this case with the authorization for the use of military force, passedby Congress on Sept. 14, signed by President Bush on Sept. 18, and still in force today.And the way I understand this proposition that we\'re voting on here, is essentially -- "Should werepeal or modify this in some way or another?'
p795
aS'" And Mike and I say, "No, we shouldn\'t.'
p796
aS'Thisshould still stand.'
p797
aS'" Juliette also agrees with us.'
p798
aS'She thinks it should stand too.'
p799
aS"I'm not surewhere Peter is.But it's worth noting exactly what is says because this is what it means to be in a War on Terror.It means to have this as your law of the land."
p800
aS'It says that the President is authorized to use allnecessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determinesplanned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11thor harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any further acts of internationalterrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.'
p801
aS"Now, our positionis quite simple: it's that this should stay the law of the land."
p802
aS"This should be the law in the UnitedStates, because, if it's not, then something Peter said is no longer the case: having the numbertwo job in al-Qaeda is no longer the most dangerous job in the world.It is today."
p803
aS"And he's still there."
p804
aS"The number two in al-Qaeda -- it's much, much diminished,decimated probably isn't too strong a word for al-Qaeda."
p805
aS"But the number two officer in al-Qaeda on 9/11, Ayman al-Zawahiri, a shadow of the man bin Laden was, he's still alive."
p806
aS"He's inPakistan."
p807
aS"But for this provision of law, we can't use military force unilaterally against him."
p808
aS"Thisis what makes such action lawful, and without this, the alternative is to go arrest him, mirandizehim, bring him back to the court, which is an option, which frankly I don't believe should betaken off the table, either."
p809
aS'Probably not what we will end up pursuing in his case.'
p810
aS'But it simplymakes no sense.'
p811
aS'It makes no sense to say you should repeal this.'
p812
aS"So that's my sort of first bigpoint to you, is this is the law of the land."
p813
aS"The war on Terror is a legal state that gives usopportunities to do things under the code of law, not extra-legally, so, if that commando teamdoes go in and kill someone, it's not murder.It is, in fact, an act of war."
p814
aS'Blessed by both branches of government -- the judiciary -- theexecutive and the legislative -- and without this, illegal.'
p815
aS"So, we don't want that."
p816
aS'And this strikesme as, clearly, sensible to continue.Now, should it continue indefinitely?'
p817
aS'Who knows?'
p818
aS"I'm not prepared to say exactly when itshould stop."
p819
aS'But right now, today, when we know, some of the perpetrators of 9/11 are still atliberty, presumably in Pakistan.'
p820
aS'It really makes no sense whatsoever to repeal this.'
p821
aS"Now,Juliette and Peter would have us think instead about the proposition in a different way, and say,It's about a mindset."
p822
aS"It's about that terrible state when John referred to when neighborswould look at a Senior White House Official's face to see how it was when he came home fromwork."
p823
aS"Those days are happily over, and hopefully they'll never come back."
p824
aS"That's really not theproposition here."
p825
aS"Yes, there were lots of that we're -- if we want to have another propositionwhich was, did President Bush overdo it in the first four years after 9/11, that's a whole differentdebate."
p826
aS'And maybe, they will prevail on that one.'
p827
aS"We're debating a different proposition here.This is not about whether we think President Bush got it just right in the first couple of yearsafter 9/11 or not."
p828
aS'This is also not really a partisan issue.'
p829
aS'And yeah, I worked for Bush.'
p830
aS'But I alsoworked for Mike Bloomberg.'
p831
aS'He--who knows what he is.'
p832
aS"I mean, he was a ---- now he's independent."
p833
aS'Then he was a Republican.'
p834
aS'At one point, he was a Democrat.'
p835
aS'This is [[laughter]] not really a partisan thing.'
p836
aS'But Peter made an interesting point.'
p837
aS'He said President Obama hasmore correctly and more precisely characterized the continued offensive action against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.'
p838
aS"And he's absolutely right, that the president -- President Obama'srhetoric is very different from President Bush's."
p839
aS'They talked about it very differently.'
p840
aS'But thepractice -- the nitty-gritty of what happens in counter-terrorism internationally, operationally,from the last four years of the Bush administration to today, in 9/11 -- not only is itfundamentally unchanged.'
p841
aS'Obama is tougher.'
p842
aS'He is harsher.'
p843
aS'He is sharper.'
p844
aS"I'll give you justone example."
p845
aS'I understand -- Mike probably knows this -- I just hear it from the news.'
p846
aS'There is alist of individuals who may be targeted, by name, individually, for lethal air strikes.'
p847
